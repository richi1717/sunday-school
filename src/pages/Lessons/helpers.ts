      '10': "Review Genesis 5\n\n| Transliteration | Translation |\n|------------------------ | ----------------- |\n| Adam | Man |\n| Seth | Appointed |\n| Enosh | Mortal |\n| Kenan | Sorrow |\n| Mahalalel | The Blessed God |\n| Jared | Shall come down |\n| Enoch | Teaching |\n| Methuselah | His death shall bring |\n| Lamech | The Despairing |\n| Noah | Rest, or comfort |\n\n###Verse 1 (talks about sons of Noah)\nNoah = comfort or rest (Strong's)/ repose, consolation (Hitchcock's)<br>\nShem = Shame, conspicuous, everyone looking at you (Strong's)/Name Renown (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHam = Hot (Strong's)/ Heat, Brown (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJapheth = Opened or expansion (Strong's)/ wide spreading, enlargement (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*This seems to tell the same story as shown in Genesis 9:18-9:29. Noah gets off the arc and is COMFORTED. He grows vineyards and gets drunk, exposed, experiences SHAME. He gets angry HOT and curses his grandson. He blesses two of his sons and says they will EXPAND and grow.\n\n###Verse 2 (talks about sons of Japheth)\nJapheth = Opened or expansion (Strong's)/ wide spreading, enlargement (Hitchcock's)<br>\nGomer = Complete (Strong's)/ Finish (Hitchcock's)<br>\nMagog = Land of Mountains (Strong's)/ covering, roof, dissolving, northern lands (Hitchcock's)<br>\nMadai = Middle land (Strong's)/ a measure, judging, a garment (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJavan = Ionia or Greece ([root] wine) (Strong's)/ deceiver, one who makes sad, Clay (Hitchcock's)<br>\nTubal = thou shall be brought (Strong's)/ the earth, the world, confusion (Hitchcock's)<br>\nMeshech = drawing out ([root] Sowing) (Strong's)/ who is drawn by force (Hitchcock's)<br>\nTiras = desire (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Note: They are growing, spreading, drawn in by the world, seems to have a negative connotation. Japheth is believed to be the father of the gentiles, so it would make sense that they would be led astray as they grow and expand into a large group of people.\n\n###Verse 3 (talks about the sons of Gomer)\nGomer = Complete (Strong's)/ Finish (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAshkenaz = A man as sprinkled: fire as scattered (Strong's)/ Fire that spreads (Hitchcock's)<br>\nRiphath = Spoken (Strong's)/ remedy, medicine, release, pardon (Hitchcock's)<br>\nTogarmah = thou wilt break her (Strong's)/ which is all bone (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Not sure. Sense of idea of spreading sin throughout humanity, needs cure because it causes pain and suffering\n\n###Verse 4 (talks about sons of Javan)\nJavan = Ionia or Greece ([root] wine) (Strong's)/ deceiver, one who makes sad, Clay (Hitchcock's)<br>\nElishah = God of the coming (one) (Strong's)/ it is God, the lamb of God: God that gives help (Hitchcock's)<br>\nTarshish = Yellow Jasper (Strong's)/ contemplation, examination (Hitchcock's)<br>\nKittim = Bruisers (Strong's)/ Breaking, bruising small, gold, coloring (Hitchcock's)<br>\nDodanim = Leaders (Strong's)/ <br>\n*Note…speculation..could be deceiver makes sad, but God is coming. Contemplate that, examine yourself. Your breaking, your leaders are making you break.\n\n###Verse 5 (talks about people being separated into their lands. Perhaps tying together verses 2-4)\n*Coastal gentiles spread from Javan or Gomer or Japheth?\n\n###Verse 6 (talks about the sons of Ham)\nHam = Hot (Strong's)/ Heat, Brown, sun burnt (Hitchcock's)<br>\nCush = Black (Strong's)/ Ethiopians, blackness (Hitchcock's)<br>\nMizraim = Land of the Copts (a sub group of people in Egypt) (Strong's)/ tribulations, two Egypts, red soil (Hitchcock's)<br>\nPut = A bow (Strong's)/ <br>\nCanaan = Lowland, flat [root] humiliated (Strong's)/ merchant, trader, or that humbles or subdues (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Some people postulate that certain races came from certain people, and the people of African descent came from Ham. Looking at the meanings, it makes sense why people might think this. It is hot, darkness and tribulations. Separation from God, fighting (bow). What we need to do is humble ourselves.\n\n###Verse 7a (talks about the sons of Cush, son of Ham)\nCush = Black (Strong's)/ Ethiopians, blackness (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSeba = Drink thou (Strong's)/ a drunkard, that turns (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHavilah = Circle (Strong's)/ that suffers pain, that brings forth (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSabtah = Striking (Strong's)/ a going about or circuiting, old age (Hitchcock's)<br>\nRaamah = Horse’s mane (Strong's)/ greatness, thunder, some sort of evil (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSabtecha = Striking (Strong's)/ that surrounds, that causes wounding (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*note: More of the despair of humanity. Blackness, drunkardness, suffering, pain over and over, a lifetime and generations of evil that causes wounds.\n\n###Verse 7b (talks about sons of Raamah)\nRaamah = Horse’s mane (Strong's)/ greatness, thunder, some sort of evil (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSheba = Seven or An oath (Strong's)/ captivity, old man, oath (Hitchcock's)<br>\nDedan = Low country (Strong's)/ friendship, a judge (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Not sure…foreshadowing of Exodus? God makes Joseph great, #2 in all the land. To avoid the famine, he brings the Israelites into Egypt. Pharoah is evil and places them into captivity. God comes to be a friend and judge to release His people. It’s a stretch…but reminded me\n\n###Verse 8 (talks about another of Cush’s sons, Nimrod)\nCush = Black (Strong's)/ Ethiopians, blackness (Hitchcock's)<br>\nNimrod = rebellion or the valiant (Strong's)/ <br>\n*He is a son later in life maybe? Seems to be set apart here. This verse is about Nimrod, and he is a valiant man.\n\n###Verse 9\nNimrod was a mighty hunter (to chase game or to lie in wait for prey)\n\n###Verse 10 (talking about kingdoms Nimrod has set up…maybe one of the first kings/leaders in Bible)\nAnd was = Haya = came into existence<br>\nBabel = confusion (Strong's)/ confusion, mixture (Hitchcock's)<br>\nErech = Long (Strong's)/length, health, physic (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAccad = Subtle [root] strengthen, a fortress (Strong's)/a vessel, pitcher, spark (Hitchcock's)<br>\nCalneh = Fortress of Anu (Strong's)/ our consummation (Hitchcock's)<br>\nLand of Shinar = Country of two rivers (Strong's)/ watch of him that sleeps (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Note: Perhaps this area brought confusion, strength, river area, consummation/existence of setting up his cities.\n\n###Verse 11 (talks about how Nimrod went to other lands and built more cities)\nAssyria = A step [root] to be straight (Strong's)/ Country of Assur or Ashur (Hitchcock's)<br>\nNineveh = Abode of Ninus (Strong's)/ handsome, agreeable (Hitchcock's)<br>\nRehoboth= Wide places or streets (Strong's)/ spaces, places (Hitchcock's)<br>\nIr = watchman, city, vision (Strong's)<br>\nCalah = Vigor (Strong's)/ favorable, opportunity (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*This area seems to be flatlands, with positive vibes…agreeable, spacious, favorable. Perhaps this is why Nineveh was agreeable when the profit Jonah told them to repent..\n\n###Verse 12 (Nimrod continues building cities and Resen is his capital)\nResen = bridle [root] to curb or halter (Strong's)/ bridle or bit (Hitchcock's)<br>\nCalneh = Fortress of Anu (Strong's)/ our consummation (Hitchcock's)<br>\nNineveh = Abode of Ninus (Strong's)/ handsome, agreeable (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Name of capital city means to bridle. He is steering to his will what is happening with all of these cities. Overall meaning literally says bridle our consummation to be agreeable.\n\n###Verse 13 (about children of Mizraim, son of Ham)\nMizraim = Upper and Lower Egypt, or double straits (Strong's)/ the mourning of Egyptians (Hitchcock's)<br>\nLudim = to the firebrands: travailings [root] strife (Strong's)/ strife (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAnamim = affliction of the waters (Strong's)/ fountain, answer, affliction (Hitchcock's)<br>\nLehabim = flames [root] blade (Strong's)/ flames, inflamed, swords (Hitchcock's)<br>\nNaphtuhim = openings (Strong's)/ border people (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Note: There is definitely a feeling of mourning, sorrow, strife, affliction of the waters, seems like it could be another foreshadowing of the Exodus story. Interesting to note that the other suspected foreshadowing is the line of Ramaah, from Cush, from Ham…these people populated Egypt. They are the future Egyptians. These verses are talking about the people who will become the Egyptians and also seem to foreshadow the Exodus story! \n\n###Verse 14 (continuation of verse 13)\nPathrusim = region of the south (Strong's)/ <br>\nCasluhim = fortified (Strong's)/ hopes of life (Hitchcock's)<br>\nPhilistines = immigrants [root] to roll (in dust) (wallow) (Strong's)/ those who dwell in villages (Hitchcock's)<br>\nCaphtorim = a crown [root] encircle (Strong's)/ crown (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*This seems to continue pointing to the Exodus, specifically the Israelites. A large group of people, immigrants who wallow in the dust, dwelling in villages, have the crown.\n\n###Verse 15 (children of Canaan, child of Ham Canaan was cursed by Noah)\nCanaan = Lowland, flat [root] humiliated, merchant, trader, or that humbles or subdues (Strong's)<br>\nSidon = Hunting [root] lie in wait (Strong's)/ hunting, fishing, venison (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHeth = Terror [root] shattered (Strong's)/ trembling, fear (Hitchcock's)\n\n###Verse 16 (continuation of 15)\nJebusite = descendants of Jebus [root] threshing place [root] tread (Strong's)/ <br>\nAmorite = a sayer in the sense of publicity [root] to say (Strong's)/bitter, a rebel, a babbler (Hitchcock's)<br>\nGirgashite = dwelling on clayey soil (Strong's)/ who arrives from pilgrimage (Hitchcock's)<br>\n\n###Verse 17 (continuation)\nHivite = villagers [root] life giver [root] to show (Strong's)/ <br>\nArkite = gnawing (Strong's)/ <br>\nSinite = thorn or clay (Strong's)/ <br>\n\n###Verse 18 (continuation)\nArvadite = I shall break loose [root] a refuge for the roving [root] to tramp about or ramble (Strong's)/ wandering (Hitchcock's)<br>\nZemarite = double woolens (Strong's)/ <br>\nHamathite = fortress [root] to join -like a wall (Strong's)/ <br>\nCanaanites = zealous [root] Canaan (Strong's)/ <br>\n*This almost feels like a small story. Humiliated, they hunt and fish in fear. They wander on a pilgrimage and seem to arrive at a place where they want to start a village. They dig into clay and thorns, make wool/clothing, and build a fortress and perhaps zealously guard what they have created…Sodom and Gomorrah. (and three other cities)\n\n###Verse 19 (talks about cities the Canaanites made)\nCanaanites = zealous [root] Canaan (Strong's)/ <br>\nSidon = Hunting [root] lie in wait (Strong's)/ hunting, fishing, venison (Hitchcock's)<br>\nGerar = a lodging place [root] to drag off roughly-to saw (Strong's)/ <br>\nGaza = the strong [root] strong, vehement, harsh (Strong's)/ <br>\nSodom = burning (Strong's)/<br>\nGomorrah = submersion [root] heap (Strong's)/ <br>\nAdmah = red earth [root] to show blood (Strong's)/ <br>\nZeboiim = gazelles [root] splendor or prominence [root] amass an army, grow turgid (Strong's)/ <br>\nLasha = fissure [root] break through (Strong's)/ <br>\n*Note. Came from hunting. Feels like the people who named these cities are saying, Don’t mess with us. We created a lodging place, we are strong, we can burn you into a heap and paint the earth red with your blood. We are grand, splendid, have a large army, and we will break you. BUT…it feels like God has taken their pride and made it their fall. If you look at the meaning from God’s judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other three cities of the plain, this could be read: God will make a burning heap of their land, spilling their blood on the earth because of their pompous, bloated pride. They will be broken.\n\n###Verse 20 (ties together previous verses 6-20)\nHam = Hot (Strong's)/ Heat, Brown (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Anger of Noah and the curse he gave seems to have led to the contents of these verses.\n\n###Verse 21 (talks about children of Shem…line Jesus descended from)\nShem = Shame, conspicuous, everyone looking at you (Strong's)/Name Renown (Hitchcock's)<br>\nEber = the region beyond [root] opposite or to cross over (Strong's)/ one that passes, anger (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJapheth = Opened or expansion, wide spreading, enlargement (Strong's)/<br>\n*This is the verse that people point to saying that Japheth is the oldest, and that Shem is listed first because of importance rather than birth order. Not all think this, some believe Shem is first born. This verse brings up Eber, who is three or four generations after Shem. \n\n###Verse 22 (talks about sons of Shem, line of Jesus through Arphaxad)\nShem = Shame, conspicuous, everyone looking at you (Strong's)/Name Renown (Hitchcock's)<br>\nElam = eternity [root] to veil from sight, conceal (Strong's)/ a young man, a virgin, a secret (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAsshur = Assyria = A step [root] to be straight (Strong's)/ Country of Assur or Ashur (Hitchcock's)<br>\nArphaxad = I shall fail as the breast: he cursed the breast-bottle (Strong's)/ healer, releaser (Hitchcock's)<br>\nLud = Strife/ ludim, same as Lod: Ludim = to the firebrands: travailings [root] strife (Strong's)/ strife (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAram = exalted [root] to be elevated (Strong's)/ highness, magnificence, one that deceives, curse (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*This seems to be a prophecy of Christ. Shame leads to the need for Christ, and His name is Renown. He is eternal, behind the veil…concealed at this point, or perhaps veiled in humanity when he walks the earth. A virgin, a secret points to Christ child. He walks the straight and narrow path. He is the healer and releaser, gives spiritual meat, not just milk. He will have travailings, strife, struggle. He struggled with temptation as we do, lowering Himself to take on humanity, baring the weight of our sins on the cross. He is to be exalted and elevated in highness or magnificence. \n\n###Verse 23 (Children of Aram-not line of Jesus)\nAram = exalted [root] to be elevated (Strong's)/ highness, magnificence, one that deceives, curse (Hitchcock's)<br>\nUz = wooded [root] to consult (Strong's)/ council, words (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHul = circle [root] to twist or whirl (Strong's)/ pain, infirmary (Hitchcock's)<br>\nGether = fear (Strong's)/ the vale (valley) of trial or searching (Hitchcock's)<br>\nMash = drawn out (Strong's) = Meshech = drawing out ([root] Sowing) (Strong's)/ who is drawn by force (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*One that deceives, with council and words, twisting, pain, infirmary. Trial and searching, drawing out. Kind of reminds of the temptation in the desert. Reminds me the crown of thorns. Possible \n\n###Verse 24 (direct line of Jesus)\nArphaxad = I shall fail as the breast: he cursed the breast-bottle (Strong's)/ healer, releaser (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSalah = sprout [root] missile (dart) of attack or spear [root] to send away (Strong's)/ mission, sending (Hitchcock's)<br>\nEber = the region beyond [root] opposite or to cross over (Strong's)/ one that passes, anger (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Note: Seems to talk about Jesus. Perhaps talking about healing and growing His people in the region beyond. In Genesis 11 it will be completely lined up with each descendent. This is a portion of the whole, which we will look at in a future study.\n\n###Verse 25 (talks about sons of Eber, line of Jesus through Peleg)\nEber = the region beyond [root] opposite or to cross over (Strong's)/ one that passes, anger (Hitchcock's)<br>\nPeleg = division [root] rill, or small brook [root] to split (Strong's)/ division (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJoktan = smallness [root] to diminish (Strong's)/ small dispute, contention, disgust (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Note: overall feeling is anger, division, dispute. Possibly a passing over of these things.\n\n###Verse 26 (sons of Joktan, son of Eber, from the line of Shem)\nJoktan = smallness [root] to diminish (Strong's)/ small dispute, contention, disgust (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAlmodad = not measured (Strong's)/ measure of God (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSheleph = a drawing forth [root] to pull out (Strong's)/ who draws out (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHazarmaveth = village of death (Strong's)/ dwelling of death (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJerah = new moon [root] lunation, time from one new moon to next (Strong's)/ the moon, month, smelling sweet (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*note: not measured/measure of God is interesting because how do you measure God? You cannot. He is immeasurable. Could be saying if you diminish an immeasurable God, it leads to death. Could also be seen as we are small compared to God, who draws out death, and gives newness, smelling sweet.\n\n###Verse 27 (continuation)\nHadoram = noble honor (Strong's)/ their beauty, their power (Hitchcock's)<br>\nUzal = I shall be flooded (Strong's)/ wandering (Hitchcock's)<br>\nDiklah = palm grove (Strong's)/ his diminishing (Hitchcock's)<br>\n* not sure…\n\n###Verse 28 (continuation)\nObal = stripped bare (Strong's)/ inconvenience of old age (Hitchcock's)<br>\nAbimael = My father is El (God) (Strong's)/ a father sent from God (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSheba = Seven or An oath (Strong's)/ captivity, old man, oath (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*in old age, father or father God gives a promise\n\n###Verse 29 (continuation)\nOphir = reducing to ashes (Strong's)/ fruitful region (Hitchcock's)<br>\nHavilah = Circle (Strong's)/ that suffers pain, that brings forth (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJobab = a desert [root] to bawl (cry) (Strong's)/ sorrowful, hated (Hitchcock's)<br>\nJoktan = smallness [root] to diminish (Strong's)/ small dispute, contention, disgust (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Sorrow and sadness\n\n###Verse 30 (where Shem’s people lived)\nMesha = freedom (Strong's)/ burden, salvation (Hitchcock's)<br>\nSephar = a numbering [root] a census [root] to count (Strong's)/ book, scribe, number (Hitchcock's)<br>\n*Salvation for all\n\n###Verse 31\nShem = Shame, conspicuous, everyone looking at you (Strong's)/Name Renown (Hitchcock's)\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible",
      '11': "###Verse 1\nLanguage = śāp̄â is Lip or termination at the lip, same way we would use the word tongue<br>\nSpeech is = dāḇār is a word or a cause<br>\n*Whole world one language\n\n###Verse 2 \nJourney = nāsaʿ = Pull up tent pins<br>\nEast = qeḏem = in front of, before them<br>\nPlain = biqʿâ = a split, meaning a wide valley between mountains<br>\nLand of Shinar = Country of two rivers/ watch of him that sleeps<br>\nGenesis 10:10 this is the area where Nimrod set up several cities one of which is Babel<br>\nDwelt = yāšaḇ = Sit down<br>\n*This is one of the areas where Nimrod set up his cities one of which is Babel. They set out before them from east is more about where they are going than where they came from. \n\n###Verse 3\nLet us make = lāḇan = to make white, making bricks. Using mud and straw they would set these in the sun to dry and depending on the clay of the area they would be white or red. In the area around the Middle east and Egypt they are white.<br>\nThoroughly = śᵊrēp̄â = creamantion, thoroughly burned<br>\nFor stone = 'eḇen = a stone, for building<br>\nAsphalt = ḥēmār = bitumen rising to the surface aka tar pit. This is an abundant natural product near the shore of the Dead and Caspian Sea.<br>\n*Building walls\n\n###Verse 4\nCome = yāhaḇ = to give<br>\nLet us build = bānâ = to Build<br>\nTower = miḡdāl = a Tower with the idea of a rostrum (an ancient stage or platform for public speaking)<br>\nWhose top = rō'š = to shake, as in the head<br>\nThe Heavens = šāmayim = to be lofty, the sky<br>\nName = šēm = Shame with the idea that you are conspicuous or everyone sees you, this leads to the idea of everyone knowing you and making a name for yourself which then leads to the idea of a place of honor. This also carries the idea of the Character rather than merely what something or someone is called<br>\nScattered = pûṣ = to dash into pieces <br>\n*Public speaking platform to draw attention. They want to stick together which is in opposition to Genesis 1:28 and Genesis 9:1 where God says to fill the earth. Some people have postulated the idea that the people do not trust God and are building the tower to have a place to survive another flood.\n\n###Verse 5\nSons = bēn = the children<br>\nMan = 'āḏām = Adam<br>\n*God still sees all humanity as one family\n\n###Verse 6\nWithheld = bāṣar = to clip off, like gathering grapes or to be isolated<br>\nPurpose = zāmam = to plan or plot, usually with evil intent<br>\n*They want to avoid being isolated and God confirms that if they are allowed to continue as is then they will succeed in that goal and be able to work any evil they can imagine.\n\n###Verse 7\nConfuse = bālal = Mix, the idea of mixed food with oil and overflowing so it makes a mess<br>\nUnderstand = šāmaʿ = to hear intelligently, it idea of obedience<br>\n*In a sense God is mixing their language so people cannot order others to obey them\n\n###Verse 8\nScattered = pûṣ = to dash into pieces <br>\nCeased = ḥāḏal = to desist, to be flabby or idle<br>\nBuilding = bānâ = to Build<br>\nThe City = ʿîr = A place to be guarded could be a city or a camp<br>\n*The people have plan that is in opposition to God’s plan. (to not be scattered) The people are able to work on their plans for a time. (Partially build the city) But ultimately God’s plan is what happens. (The building stops and the people are scattered) This points to a greater the difference between God’s plan for man and man's plan for himself.\n\n###Verse 9\nTherefore = ʿal = hence, rightly or so<br>\nCalled = qārā' = to call out or proclaim<br>\nName = šēm = Shame with the idea that you are conspicuous or everyone sees you, this leads to the idea of everyone knowing you and making a name for yourself which then leads to the idea of a place of honor. This also carries the idea of the Character rather than merely what something or someone is called<br>\nBabel = confusion/ confusion, mixture<br>\nConfused = bālal = Mix, the idea of mixed food with oil and overflowing so it makes a mess<br>\nLanguage = śāp̄â is Lip or termination at the lip, same way we would use the word tongue<br>\n*Notice here that the name of the city is given because of the mixing of languages causing confusion. The name shows the character of the city. Also notice that the name is given before the city and tower are completed. So I do not think the city was given this name by Nimrod in Genesis 10:10 but rather it was given because of what God had done in the city.\n\n###Ages starting with verse 10-11\nShem: 100 begot Arphaxad, lived 500 years <br>\n*Noah was 500ish when Shem was born (Genesis 5:32). So, when Genesis 5:32 says that Noah was 500 when Shem, Ham and Japheth were born it could mean one of 3 things. First, they are triplets. Second, Shem is the oldest and Noah was 500 when Shem was born. Third, Shem is not the oldest and was listed first due to importance rather than birth order making Noah's age at Shem's birth a little older than 500. Hence 500ish. Noah was 600 when the flood was on the earth (Genesis 7:6) Noah still on the ark at 601 and got off at 601 at the end of the second month (Genesis 8:13-14). They were on the ark for a year maybe more. This means Shem was 100ish to 101ish on the ark. But this verse clearly says that Arphaxad was born 2 years after the flood. This is another reason why some believe that Shem is not the eldest son and that maybe Japheth was born when Noah was 500 and they were not triplets as far as we know so it is more likely that Shem was born a year or two after Japheth.  Making him younger but still listed first in Genesis 5:32 due to importance rather than birth order.\n\n###Verse 12-13\nArphaxad: 35 begot Salah, lived 403 years<br>\n*Some have argued that there is no way Adam could have lived 930 years (Genesis 5:5) because people do not live that long. They have postulated that the ages in Genesis must be recorded in months not years. This section on Arphaxad refutes this argument if the ages were recorded in months, then Arphaxad would have had children at 35 months old aka just under 3 years old. It is clear that the Bible is recording the ages in years as stated. \n\n###Verse 14-15\nSalah: 30 begot Eber, lived 403 years<br>\n*You may find it odd that both Arphaxad and Salah lived 403 years, however if you study statistics you will find that if a set of numbers is truly random then you will often find a streak in it and these streaks are not usually found when someone tries to fake a set of random numbers.\n\n###Verse 16-17\nEber: 34 begot Peleg, 430 years<br>\n*The first few people after the flood lived about 4 to 500 years about half the time of all the people before the flood. Something was clearly different from before the flood until after it.\n\n###Verse 18-19\nPeleg: 30 begot Reu, lived 209 years<br>\n*First person to have a sharp drop in lifespan. He also marks the time when the world was divided (Genesis 10:25, and meaning of the name). Conventional belief is that this division is marking the confusion of language and subsequent dividing of nations at the tower of Babel. Some say this is the beginning of the divine council. Some other thoughts I have are these. Does this division have something to do with lifespan? Does this have to do with the division of the land masses of the earth. When giant lakes formed after the flood spilled over causing things like the Grand Canyon raising the water level enough to have water cover over land bridges that previously connected the continents. Maybe in a divided world (land or language) it is difficult to get all types of food an eat a balanced diet? Which would then cause the less healthy people to live shorter life spans.

Everyone after Terah that I know of didn’t make it to 200. Abraham and Isaac get close at 175 and 180. But notice that Abraham considers himself to be in his old age at 100 years old Genesis 21:5-7. Jacob, at 130 years old, also points out that his forefathers lived much longer than him Genesis 47:9\n\n###Verse 10-26 (Start of next record in the line to Jesus)\nShem = šēm = Name or Renown or Fame or All eyes on you or Conspicuous position (Strong’s)<br>\nArphaxad = 'arpaḵšaḏ = I Shall fail as the breast or he cursed the breast-bottle (Strong’s)<br>\nSalah = šelaḥ = Sprout or Dart or Shoot of growth [compare sent] (Strong’s)<br>\nEber = ʿēḇer = The region beyond or Region across (Strong’s)<br>\nPeleg = peleḡ = Division or Channel/Canal or Earthquake (Strong’s)<br>\nReu = rᵊʿû = Friend or Friendly pasture (Strong’s)<br>\nSerug = śᵊrûḡ = Branch or Tendril (Strong’s)<br>\nNahor = nāḥôr = Snorting or Snorer (Strong’s)<br>\nTerah = teraḥ = Station or Delay or place in the desert (Strong’s)<br>\nAbram = 'aḇrām = exalted father or High father (Strong’s)<br>\n(Abraham = 'ăḇîrām = my father is exalted or the exalted one is my father (Strong’s))\n\nShem = šēm = Name or Renown (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nArphaxad = 'arpaḵšaḏ = a healer, a releaser (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nSalah = šelaḥ = mission, sending (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nEber = ʿēḇer = one that passes, anger (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nPeleg = peleḡ = division (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nReu = rᵊʿû = his friend, his shepherd (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nSerug = śᵊrûḡ = branch, layer, twining (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nNahor = nāḥôr = hoarse, dry, hot (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nTerah = teraḥ = breathe, scent, blow (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nAbram = 'aḇrām = high father (Hitchcock’s)<br>\n(Abraham = 'ăḇîrām = Father of a Great multitude (Hitchcock’s))\n\n*Cainan = Fixed position, Possession (Strong’s)/ Possessor, Purchaser (Hitchcock’s) (Luke 3:36) (Aramaic Root)<br>\nKenan = Sorrow, Dirge, elegy (Genesis 5:9-14) (Koinonia House)<br>\nEnosh’s son was named Kenan, from which can mean “sorrow,” dirge,” or “elegy.” (The precise denotation is somewhat elusive; some study aids unfortunately presume an Aramaic root synonymous with “Cainan.”) Balaam, looking down from the heights of Moab, employed a pun upon the name of the Kenites when he prophesied their destruction.

In the Septuagint Genesis 11:12-13 says that Arphaxad begot Cainan/Kenan at 35 and then Cainan/Kenan at 130 years begot Shelah. Then Cainan/Kenan later died at 330 years. I personally don’t know what to make of this. First, of all there is a disagreement about even the definition of the word used is it Cainan or Kenan. Second, is there a contradiction in the bible? Third is there a problem with the recording of ether the Bible we use today or the Septuagint version that Luke apparently used? Fourth is God by removing Kenan saying that he is removing sorrow? I don’t really know and I have tried to find the answer to this one question for over 10 years now.\n\n\nPicking and choosing what I see is this:<br>\n The renowned healer sent across the divide; Shepard’s the branch in the desert to give breath of the exalted father.<br>\nWhat do you think?\n\nPut it all together Genesis 5 and 11:<br>\nMan appointed mortal sorrow; The Blessed God shall come down teaching His death shall bring the despairing rest.

      '12': "###Verse 1\nLORD = Yᵊhōvâ = or YAWH Name of the Lord<br>\nFrom your family = môleḏeṯ = Land of nativity<br>\n*Strait forward God is calling Abram to move to a new and that God will show him\n\n###Verse 2\nNation = gôy = a foreign nation, a gentile, a troop of animals, a swarm of locust<br>\nBless = bāraḵ = to kneel<br>\nName = šēm = Conspicuous position, mark of individuality, character<br>\nBlessing = bᵊrāḵâ = Benediction (expression of good wishes), implying prosperity<br>\n*Name marks you but as an individual and points to the character of the person. So, name meanings seem to have more to them than merely an identifier. It seems they tell what kind of person this is or what they will do rather than a word to identify one person from another.\n\n###Verse 3\nBless = bāraḵ = to kneel (2x) <br>\nCurses = 'ārar = to execrate (to declare to be hateful, to denounce, to feel loathing for or invoke a curse on) <br>\nCurse = qālal = to make light, or slight or small<br>\nFamilies = mišpāḥâ = family, a group. When used for people it’s a family, can also be used for a group or type of animal or a type or sort of things. <br>\nOf the earth = 'ăḏāmâ = Soil or ground, the stuff Adam is made of<br>\n*Bless is written twice so this shows emphasis. Notice that the Lord says that those who hate or despise Abrams family He will make small. Also notice that the blessing that will come to all the earth will be though Abram's family. This blessing is Jesus. Later many of the decedents of Abram will take the meaning of this as the Lord’s blessing is only for them, but we need to be aware that the blessing is for all the earth but will come through Abrams family.\n\n###Verse 4\nDeparted = yālaḵ = to walk, to carry<br>\nSpoken = dāḇar = to arrange, figuratively arrange words or speak, rarely used to subdue<br>\nAbram = exalted father or High father (Strong’s)/ high father (Hitchcock’s) <br>\nLot = Covering, veil (Strong’s)/Lotan, wrapt up, hidden, covered, myrrh, rosin (Hitchcock’s) <br>\n*Abram was 75 when he departed Haran the place. Lot when with him who was the son of Haran, Abram's brother (Genesis 11:27). Haran died in Ur where he was born (Genesis 11:28). The whole family departed from Ur to the land of Haran (Genesis 11:31). Terah, Abram’s father died in Haran at 205 (Genesis 11:32).  The LORD tells Abram to leave Haran, the place (Genesis 12:1). Genesis 12:1 seems to have the connotation of happening after the death of Terah. This is why there is some debate in this section when discussing the age of the earth. If Abram was 75 when he left Haran and left after the death of his father, who died at 205 then Terah was 130 when Abram was born. However, Genesis 11:26 says that Terah was 70 when he begot Abram, Nahor and Haran. Again, the debate is the same as with Shem, Ham and Japheth. Is Abram listed first because of birth order or because of importance. Or maybe there is another set of triplets. I lean toward Terah being 130 because following the story it makes more since to me. If Terah was 70 when Haran, the brother, was born in Ur. 60 years later at 130 Terah had Abram and around the same time around 60 years old Haran had Lot. This would make Abram and Lot his nephew around the same age. Abram and Lot would both receive their portion of the inheritance, which would explain why they each had their own flocks and household. The counter argument is that Abram was born first and Haran was born within 2 or 3 years. Haran has Lot sometime before he dies. This would make Lot anywhere from 50 to 15 when he leaves with Abram. Genesis 12:1 would be the LORD telling Abram to leave his father before his father dies. This would mean that Abram and Lot left without an inheritance when Tera was 145 years old. Ultimately it does not affect salvation so believe whichever you like but it does affect the count of the age of the earth by about 60 years depending on which way you choose. \n\n###Verse 5\nPossessions = rᵊḵûš = property<br>\nThey had gathered = rāḵaš = to lay up, collect<br>\nThe people = nep̄eš = breathing creature, vitality<br>\n*Abram and Lot left with all their property, likely the inheritance after the death of Terah, and went from Haran = Mountainous area to Canaan = Lowland.\n\n###Verse 6\nThe place = māqôm = Standing place, spot [root: to rise]<br>\nShechem = šᵊḵem = Back, Shoulder, The Neck, Ridge, Spur of a Hill, figuratively: The place of burdens (Strong’s)/ Part, Portion, Back early in the morning (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nTerebinth tree = 'ēlôn = an oak, oak-grove, place in Palestine [root: something strong]<br>\nMoreh = môrê = Teacher, A hill, an archer, the early rain [root: to flow] (Strong’s)/ Stretching (Hitchcock’s)<br>\nCanaanites = kᵊnaʿănî = inhabitant of Canaan, pedlar or merchant<br>\n*Interesting thought looking at the meanings of the names Abram passes through the place of burdens and comes to the strong tree of the teacher. A little reminiscent of Jesus being tree that Abram and all of us are grown from.\n\n###Verse 7\nDescendants = zeraʿ = seed, fruit, sowing-time, posterity<br>\nAlter = mizbēaḥ = Alter [root: slaughter and animal]<br>\n*The LORD gives the land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants\n\n###Verse 8\nAnd he moved = ʿāṯaq = to remove, to grow old, to transcribe<br>\nEast = qeḏem = the front, A place to the east, a time before<br>\nBethel = bêṯ-'ēl = House of God, also a place in Palestine [root: house and God]<br>\nPitched = nāṭâ = to stretch or spread out, to bend away (including moral deflection) (wide application) <br>\nWest = yām = to roar, a sea, Mediterranean sea, the west, rarely the south. <br>\nAi = ʿay = Heap of ruins, [root: ruins] <br>\n*West is to roar like the sound of the sea. Nearly always pointing west to the Mediterranean but rarely to the south. Maybe talking about the Red Sea?\n\n###Verse 9\nSouth = neḡeḇ = to be parched, south in the area of drought and desert<br>\n*It seems that directions are centered with a point of view of being in the promised land. We normally think of south as heading to a point, the south pole and west as always pointing in the same way no matter where you are. Thus, Dora could be both east and west all depending on your perspective. But here west seems to point to the Mediterranean Sea and south seems to point to the desert wilderness or even Egypt. The only place in the world,  that I can think of, where both of these locations would match the direction is in the promised land.\n\n###Verse 10\nFamine = rāʿāḇ = hunger [root: to be roomy, or to desire] <br>\nWent down = yāraḏ = to descend (go to lower region, go to the shore, go to the enemy) <br>\nEgypt = miṣrayim = Land of the Copts, Double Straits, Upper and lower Egypt, [root: fortified border] <br>\nDwell = gûr = turn aside from the road, sojourn, to shink, fear of a strange place<br>\nSevere = kāḇēḏ = Heavy, (Good sense – numerous, Bad sense – severe, difficult) [root: to make heavy] <br>\n*It seems like several times in the Bible people go to Egypt when there is hardship, Jesus himself goes into Egypt to avoid execution as a child. Interesting here that the words used for going to Egypt can carry the connotation of going to the enemy and to the word for living there can carry the connotation of having the fear of being in a new place. There are several times in the Bible where God seems to use Egypt for his purposes even though, or maybe because, they do not worship the LORD.\n\n###Verse 11\nWas close = qāraḇ = approach<br>\nWife = 'iššâ = woman [root: contracted for and man] (same word used for multiple women) <br>\nIndeed = hinnê = lo, behold<br>\nI Know = yāḏaʿ = to know<br>\nBeautiful = yāp̄ê = beautiful [root: to be bright] <br>\nCountenance = rā'â = a view, an appearance, a vision [root: to see] <br>\n*Wonder where “yada, yada, yada” saying came from? Maybe here “I know, I know, I know”? Also, interesting to note that the word for Woman which is the same one used in Genesis 2 comes from the root of being contracted for. We can see even within the language that the LORD created man and woman to be joined together as one.\n\n###Verse 12\nKill = hāraḡ = Smite with deadly intent<br>\n*Notice Abrams focus, Fear of his own death\n\n###Verse 13\nSister = 'āḥôṯ = sister [root: brother] <br>\nIt may be well = yāṭaḇ = to be or make well, literally: sound beautiful, figuratively: be happy, successful, or right<br>\nBecause of you = gālāl = a circumstance, on account of [root: to roll, as in roll away a stone] <br>\n*It seems like the language has preserved the creation the root word for woman is man and root for sister is brother. This points to the LORD making woman by taking a part of man. I wonder if this is true in other languages? Maybe the LORD preserved this in all the languages when the languages were confused at the tower of Babel. Another thing I find interesting here is the idea that the phrase “because of you” is a word whose root means to roll away, like rolling away a stone. This to me is another instance of pointing to Jesus. Within this verse is the idea that someone can sacrifice themself to save the life of another and the word used to describe that act comes from the idea of rolling away a stone. I may be stretching here but this was interesting to me.\n\n###Verse 14\nWoman = 'iššâ = woman [root: contracted for and man] (same word used for multiple women) <br>\n*Here we see Woman and Wife are the same word. \n\n###Verse 15\nPrinces = śar = a head person (of any rank or class) <br>\nPharaoh = parʿô = Great House, title given for Egyptian kings<br>\nCommend = hālal = to be clear, to shine, make to show, to boast, to be foolish, to rave, to celebrate, to stultify (stultify means to be stupid or to claim a contract), give in marriage. <br>\nHouse = bayiṯ = Household, the family<br>\n*The idea with halal (commend) is this: things that are lawful and unlawful are clear and should have no room for doubt. This word is still used today in the Muslim community mostly associated with food laws. For us in this verse we can see that Sari is clearly and lawfully given to Pharaoh. She is his wife or concubine. And was taken to Pharaoh’s household. She is now a member of Pharaoh’s family. \n\n###Verse 16\nSheep = ṣō'n = to migrate, a flock, figuratively can be used for a group of men<br>\nOxen = bāqār = a beeve (means an animal made of beef), collectively a herd<br>\nMale donkey = ḥămôr = a male donkey (specifically means “dun red” which is a tan coloring on donkeys and horses) [root: to boil up, to ferment, to glow with redness, to smear with pitch] <br>\nMale Servants = ʿeḇeḏ = a servant, a slave, in bondage [root: to work] <br>\nFemale Servants = šip̄ḥâ = to spread out (grow family), a female slave [root: a family] <br>\nCamels = gāmāl = a camel (with the idea of carrying a burden) [root: to treat or deal with a person could be good or bad but the idea of giving bountifully or recompense or repay] <br>\n*Feels like merchants and camels are linked. So what does this interaction tell us about the faith of Abram? Seems to me at a minimum Abram is having difficulty believing the LORD’s promise. The LORD told Abram in Genesis 12:2 that He would bless him and make of Abram a great nation. Seems like that can’t happen if Abram is killed in Egypt. To me this looks like Abram’s faith is weak but we know Abraham is lifted up as an example of great faith in Hebrews 11. What happened? Yes Abram did have faith enough to follow the LORD’s call to leave for the promise land. But here it seems like Abram is not quite so sure and chooses to take matters into his own hand.\n\n###Verse 17\nPlagued = nāḡaʿ = to touch, to reach violently, to strike<br>\nPlagues = neḡaʿ = to blow, figuratively cause infliction, a spot, a leprous person<br>\n*But the LORD is faithful to us even when we struggle with our faith toward him\n\n###Verse 18\nWhat = mâ = What as a question including how, why, when, also What as an exclamation, even what as indifferent like whatever<br>\nYou have done = ʿāśâ = to do something very broad sense<br>\nUnto me? = לִּי = no strongs reference letters are Lamed and Yod (reverse order) <br>\nWhy = mâ = What as a question including how, why, when, also What as an exclamation, even what as indifferent like whatever<br>\ntell = nāḡaḏ = to front, to stand boldly out opposite, to announce, to expose, predict, explain, or praise<br>\n*Lamed is a staff or goad it typically carries a meaning of teaching or correction. Yod a small letter that represents a single point from which all creation emerges. Used to carry the idea of divine spark, creation, unity especially with the creator. So, from what I can tell this thing that Pharaoh is talking about having something done to him seems like he had a correction from the LORD as the thing that happened to him. Which seems to line up with the plagues. Here Pharaoh is wondering why Abram did not tell the truth about his wife.\n\n###Verse 19\nTo me = 'ănî = I <br>\n*this word can be written in two ways in Hebrew one like this: אֲנִי (Aleph, Nun, Yod) and one like this: לִי (Lamed, Yod). Notice the second version is very similar to the word in verse 18 with no reference. The one in verse 18 has an different accent marks than the one in verse 19. The translation in verse 19 is to me. In verse 18 its unto me so maybe that is where the translation comes from in verse 18 even though there is no reference.\n\n###Verse 20\nCommanded = ṣāvâ = to constitute, to enjoin. (enjoin means to direct or order something, to require and impose, to prohibit or forbid) <br>\nHe had = לֽוֹ = Yet another word with no reference. (Lamed and Vav) <br>\n*A question that sometimes comes up is why would the LORD punish Pharaoh for what Abram did. The best answer I have found is that the LORD is not punishing Pharaoh but protecting Sari and preserving His word and promise to Abram. Yes, Abram should have had more trust that the LORD would protect Abram rather than using his own wife to protect himself. Pharaoh making a haram of all the pretty women and being willing to kill for them as implied by Abram means he is not some innocent party. So, the LORD used the plagues to warn Pharaoh and protect Sari and Abram.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible",
      '13': "###Verse 1\nHe had = לוֹ = no Strong’s reference (Lamed, Vav) same thing found in Genesis 12:20<br>\n*Lamed is shepards staff or goad, Vav is wholeness. So I guess the idea is Abram leads or drives the whole amount that seems to line up with the translation to point to everything that “he had”\n\n###Verse 2\nVery = mᵊ'ōḏ = Vehemence (intensely or passionately) <br>\nRich = kāḇaḏ = to be heavy, can be used for good (rich, numerous, honorable), bad (burdensome, severe, dull) or causative (to be weighty) <br>\nlivestock = miqnê = something bought, typically referring to livestock [root: to erect, to create, to own] <br>\nSilver = kesep̄ = Silver (from the pale color), by implication money [root: to become pale] <br>\nGold = zāhāḇ = to shimmer, gold, something gold colored, oil, a clear sky (as in fair weather) <br>\n*Interesting that both Silver and Gold are named for their color and in English it is the same. \n\n###Verse 3\nBethel = bêṯ-'ēl = house of God<br>\n*Bethel is repeated twice here so it is emphasized. <br>\nPlace = māqôm = a standing spot [root: to rise] <br>\nAt the beginning = tᵊḥillâ = opening, a commencement [root: to bore a hole] <br>\nHai = ʿay = heap of ruins [root: a ruin] <br>\n*Abram travels back home to the promised land where he was before he went down to Egypt. Due to the Nile River Egypt is better able to withstand famine.\n\n###Verse 4\nUnto = 'ēl = motion toward<br>\nAlter = mizbēaḥ = Alter [root: slaughter an animal] <br>\nAt first = ri'šôn = First in place, time or rank<br>\n*Animal Sacrifice is required to atone for sin in the Old Testament to point to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus for sin. Leviticus 17:11 says the life of the flesh is in the blood and life is required to atone for your life. The biblical perspective of animal sacrifice comes with the idea of humbly coming before the LORD to offer life. Not to gain anything from that life but to show the gravity of what sin brings into our lives. Contrast this with animal sacrifice in other religions. Animal sacrifice has been twisted to be a good thing. Ether the deity desires the sacrifice or people use the life of the animal as some kind of supposed power source for magic. This is completely opposite of the LORD’s original intent.\n\n###Verse 5\n*Lot, it seems, went with Abram into Egypt and is now returning with him. It is possible that Lot was a part of Abram household but he has his own stuff so he likely had his own household. Separate from Abram\n\n###Verse 6\nThe land = 'ereṣ = to be firm, the earth, the land<br>\nAble to Support = nāśā' = to lift, to carry, to take<br>\nThat they might dwell = yāšaḇ = to sit down, (implication to judge, ambush, dwell, remain, settle or marry) <br>\nTogether = yaḥaḏ = a unit, united [root: to become one] <br>\nPossessions = rᵊḵûš = property, goods [root: to lay up or collect] <br>\nGreat = raḇ = abundant, much, many, great [root: to cast together, to increase, to become many] <br>\nThey could = yāḵōl = to be able, (literally the ability or power to do something, Morally, you may do something or it is allowed) <br>\nNot = lō' = particle used to indicate the negation of something, not, no<br>\n*Here we come to the point where Abram and Lot realize they each are too wealthy to live together and need to separate.\n\n###Verse 7\nStrife = rîḇ = a contest, (personal or legal dispute) [root: to toss, to grapple, to strive, to contend] <br>\nHerdsmen = rōʿê = Shepard, pastoral (as in a person who raises livestock on a pasture) <br>\nCanaanites = kᵊnaʿănî = Zealous, (implication a pedlar or mechant) [root: canaan is lowland, humiliated, merchant or trader] <br>\nPerizzites = pᵊrizzî = Belonging to a village, inhabitant of the open country<br>\n*To me this implies that there are two places they can go the city or the country\n\n###Verse 8\n*Everything here is pretty straightforward Abram and Lot are trying to avoid strife between their people\n\n###Verse 9\nSeparate = pāraḏ = to break through, to spread out, to divide<br>\nLeft = śam'al = pass to the left direction, use the left hand<br>\nLeft hand = śᵊmō'l = dark, the north, the left hand, the left [root: dress, cloak {root: image, statue, idol}]<br>\nRight = yāman = to be physically right, to be right-handed to take the right-hand side<br>\nRight hand = yāmîn = the right hand or side, stronger, more dexterous, the south<br>\n*In English Dexter means right-handed and Sinister means left-handed, and ambidextrous means two right hands. It is interesting that here the word for right-handed carries the idea of strength and the word for left-handed carries the idea of darkness. To me this give a little more insight into my dad’s favorite verse, Ecclesiastes 10:2. Solomon writes that a wise man’s heart is on his right-hand side and a fool’s heart is on his left-hand side. Now my dad likes to use this to make a political joke, but it seems Solomon may have been referencing the meaning of strength and dexterity verses darkness, hidden under a cloak. \n\n###Verse 10\nEyes = ʿayin = an eye, a fountain or spring<br>\nPlain = kikār = a circle, a circumjacent tract or region (circumjacent is surrounded or boarded on all sides), a valley like the Ghor or Jordan, a loaf of bread (round), a talent (round). [root: dance, whirl] <br>\nJordan = yardēn = Descender, principle river of Palestine [root: to decend] <br>\nWell Watered = mašqê = causing to drink, a drink, Figuratively used to mean a well-watered region. [root: to quaff (quaff means to drink heartily or luxuriously), to irrigate, to furnish a portion] <br>\nDestroy = šāḥaṯ = to decay, ruin<br>\nGarden = gan = a garden, Garden of Eden<br>\nSodom = sᵊḏōm = Burning, scorched<br>\nGomorrah = ʿămōrâ = Submersion, buried, a ruined heap [root: to heap, to chastise (chastise means to punish for wrongdoing)] <br>\nZoar = ṣōʿar = Insignificance, little [root: to be small] <br>\n*Notice here that destroy comes from a different word than the one used in Genesis 6:7. The word in 6:7 means to rub smooth. The LORD says he will smooth mankind in 6:7 then later in Genesis 6:13 he says he will destroy the people with a flood using the same word we find here to corrupt or ruin. Notice when Noah and his family is included, the LORD will destroy (make smooth) mankind. But when speaking about the remaining people outside of Noah and his family the LORD says he will destroy (corrupt or ruin) them. As he will destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n###Verse 11\nChose = bāḥar = to try, to select<br>\nJourney = nāsaʿ = to pull up tent pins<br>\nSeparated = pāraḏ = to break through, to spread, or separate<br>\nEach = 'îš = Man<br>\nOther = 'āḥ = Brother<br>\n*Lot and Abram separate from eachother\n\n###Verse 12\nLand = ereṣ = to be firm, the earth, the land<br>\n Cities = ʿîr = a city, a place to be guarded [root: to wake, open the eyes, (literal or figuratively)] <br>\n*Lot lives in the city of Sodom and Abram lives in the country\n\n###Verse 13\nExceedingly = mᵊ'ōḏ = Vehemence, wholly, speedily [root: to rake together, a poker for moving embers] <br>\nWicked = raʿ = bad, evil [root: to spoil, to make good for nothing] <br>\nSinners = ḥaṭṭā' = a criminal, one accounted guilty [root: (the word for sin) to miss the mark, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn] <br>\n*It seems like we are slowly moving away from the LORD as a country. Sodom and Gomorrah are already there. Yet for some reason this is where Lot chooses to live.\n\n###Verse 14\nNorthward = ṣāp̄ôn = hidden, dark, the north quarter gloomy and unknown<br>\nSouthward = neḡeḇ = to be parched, the south from its drought<br>\nEastward = qeḏem = in front, the past, ancient, east<br>\n Westward = yām = to roar, a sea, Mediterranean Sea, sometimes a large river or artificial basin, west and rarely south<br>\n*We discussed these before but here they are all in one verse. The LORD is leading Abram where he is to go.\n\n###Verse 15\nTo thee = לְךָ = no Strong’s reference. Here we have a Lamed and Dalet. Lamed is goad and Dalet is door so maybe they get “to thee” from the idea of pushing through the door? <br>\nFor- = ʿaḏ = as far as<br>\nEver = ʿôlām = the vanishing point<br>\n*Each Hebrew letter is a word by itself like in English the word “a” or “I”. For them every letter has a meaning. Some people believe that other Hebrew words can be found in the meaning of the base letters. Others believe that the letters for words are chosen purely for the sound they create and the meanings of the individual parts give no meaning to the word as a whole. I’m not sure where I stand on this. I would need to look into it more. In this verse the LORD is giving to Abram all the land he can see from wherever his standing spot is.\n\n###Verse 16\nI will make = śûm = to put<br>\nDecendents = zeraʿ = seed, fruit, plant, sowing time, offspring [root: to sow, to scatter seed] <br>\nDust = ʿāp̄ār = dust, clay, earth, mud [root: to be grey, to pulverize, to be dust] <br>\nCan = yāḵōl = to be able, used literally – can or could, used morally – may or might<br>\nNumber = mānâ = to weigh out, to allot, to enumerate<br>\nAlso = gam = to gather, assemblage, moreover, also<br>\n*Here we see the LORD confirming his promise to Abram given in Genesis 12:2. We do also get more clarification that this will not fit into our own ideas of how many people constitute a nation. This will be an uncountable multitude of people that will come from Abram. Romans 9:8 confirms that the people included in this number are more than just the children of flesh but all of us are considered to be counted among the seed.\n\n###Verse 17\nLength = ōreḵ = length, could be distance or time [root: to make or be long, draw out] <br>\nWidth = rōḥaḇ = witdth, breadth [root: to broaden or enlarge] <br>\nTo you = לְךָ = another word with no Strong’s reference. <br>\n*The LORD has Abram walk the land that he has been given\n\n###Verse 18\nAbram = 'aḇrām = exalted Father, High Father<br>\nDwelt = yāšaḇ = to sit down, to remain to settle, to marry<br>\nTerebinth trees = 'ēlôn = an oak or other strong tree [root: strength] <br>\nMamre = mamrē' = strength, fatness, lusty (as in something desirable) [root: to rebel, to whip] Hitchcock’s: rebellious, bitter, set with trees<br>\nHebron = ḥeḇrôn = association, seat of association, [root: a society, a spell {root of root: to join, to charm or fascinate (sometimes by means of spells)}] Hitchcock’s: Society, friendship<br>\n*Notice the word yāšaḇ here we translate to “dwell” has the idea of where you plan to live, and this is very different from the word “gûr“, translated to “dwell” in Genesis 12:10 which has the idea of turning aside from the road and has the idea of staying in a new place while afraid. Both instances are translated to “dwell” but have different flavors that we may miss or be lost in translation that would have been clear to the Hebrew people. The word “'ēlôn” translated to “terebinth trees”, that means oak or some other strong tree is translated to “in the plain” in the King James Version. \n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible",

Which is located along the Euphrates River in modern day Iraq about 50 miles south of Bagdad. These four kings band together to start some trouble with in Canaan. If we look back at Genesis 10:8-10 we see this is the continuation of the kingdom set up by Nimrod in the area of Babylon. This is also the place where the tower of Babel was started and abandoned \n\n###Verse 2\nWar = milḥāmâ = a battle, generally war [root: to feed on, to consume] <br>\nBera = beraʿ = Son of evil, Hitchcock’s: a well, declaring<br>\n-Sodom = sᵊḏōm = burning, to scorch, burnt, Hitchcock’s: their secret, their cement<br>\nBirsha = biršaʿ = with iniquity (iniquity means to be guilty of sin), with wickedness [root: a wrong (especially moral)], Hitchcock’s: an evil, a son who beholds<br>\n-Gomorrah = ʿămōrâ = submersion, a ruined heap [root: to heap, to chastise, to gather grain], Hitchcock’s: rebellious people<br>\nShinab = šin'āḇ = splendour of the father, a father has turned [root: to change or alter and father], Hitchcock’s: father of changing<br>\n-Admah = 'aḏmâ = red earth, earthy [root: soil], Hitchcock’s: earthy, red, bloody<br>\nShemeber = šem'ēḇer = lofty flight, illustrious [name of pinion; root: (name) conspicuous position, appellation (the act of naming or a title), honor, authority, character and a pinion (means terminal section of a bird wing, or to restrain/disable/shackle, or a small gear paired with a larger one called a rack; here the bird wing is what this is referring to], Hitchcock’s: name of force, name of the strong<br>\n-Zebolim = ṣᵊḇā'îm = gazelles, [root: prominence, splendor], Hitchcock’s: deer, goats<br>\n-Bela = belaʿ = destruction, gulp/swallow [root: to make away with, to destroy] <br>\n--Zoar = ṣōʿar = insignificance, little [root: to be small], Hitchcock’s: little, small<br>\n*We see four kings from Babylon area attacking 5 kings of Canaan area. If we look back to Genesis 10:19 we see when these five cities were established. They were established by the descendants of Canaan. He was the one that Noah cursed in Genesis 9:25. Both Nimrod and Canaan are descendants of Ham. \n-Bunny trail: looking at the idea behind the word Zebolim translated Gazelle, Deer or Goat and the root of that word meaning prominence or splendor, I am reminded of Matthew 25:31-46. In this section Jesus separates the sheep from the goats. If you consider this with the concept, found throughout the Bible, that the LORD cares about the heart, this may shed some light on the meaning here. The goat is full of splendor, wanting to stand out from the crowd on its own. This points to the idea that the person wanting to be like a goat would, in their heart, feel that they do not need help from Jesus, they can do it on their own. While a sheep, is a herd animal, the sheep need the shepherd, Jesus. Sheep are not prominent or full of splendor on their own, they follow Jesus and need his help. \n\n###Verse 3\nValley = ʿēmeq = a vale (a valley often coursed by a stream [root: to be deep] <br>\nSiddim = śidîm = field or plain, flats [root: to spread out] <br>\nthat is = hû' = who, he, she, it, self, this, that, which and occasionally as or are<br>\nSalt = melaḥ = powder, salt [root: to pulverize, to disappear as dust, to season or rub with salt] <br>\nSea = yām = to roar, a sea (because of the noise) large body of water, west<br>\n\n###Verse 4\nTweleve = šᵊnayim = dual, two, twofold [root: double, second, again {root: to fold (the action), duplicate, repeat, to transmute, change] <br>\nTweleve = ʿeśer = ten (only in combination), teen, tenth [root: ten, all of the digits {root: to accumulate, to tithe, to take or give a tenth/ or accent marks; to grow, to be rich}]<br>\nYears = šānâ = a year, a revolution of time/ or accent marks; to fold (the action), duplicate, repeat, to transmute, change. <br>\nThey served = ʿāḇaḏ = to work, to serve, till the ground, enslave<br>\nThirteenth = šālôš = three, third, thrice, triad<br>\nThirteenth = ʿeśer = ten (only in combination), teen, tenth [root: ten, all of the digits {root: to accumulate, to tithe, to take or give a tenth/ or accent marks; to grow, to be rich}]<br>\nRebelled = māraḏ = to rebel, to disobey<br>\n*Work is same word for Adam and Eve tending the Garden Genesis 2:5 and same word used in ten commandments Exodus 20:5 and 9. Here we see that the 5 kings of the area of Sodom and Gomorrah were under the rule of the 4 kings of Babylon area for 12 years then in the 13th year they decided to rebel and no longer work for the 4 kings. Also note that the compound words we use for 12 and 13 are in written as 2 separate words in Hebrew 2 and 10 or 3 and 10.\n\n###Verse 5\nFourteenth = 'arbaʿ = four [root: to be four sided/ or accent marks; to lay flat on all fours] <br>\nFourteenth = ʿeśer = ten (only in combination), teen, tenth [root: ten, all of the digits {root: to accumulate, to tithe, to take or give a tenth/ or accent marks; to grow, to be rich}]<br>\nAttacked = nāḵâ = to strike, or smite<br>\nRephaim = rᵊp̄ā'îm = invigorating, a giant [root: to mend, to cure] <br>\n-Ashteroth = ʿaštᵊrôṯ = name of a deity of fertility, star, increase flock [root: to accumulate, to grow, to be rich] <br>\n-Karnaim = qarnayim = Dual of horns, flask, cornet, elephant tusks, alter horn, mountain peak, ray of light or figuratively power [root: to push, to gore, to shoot out horns, to shoot out rays or shine] <br>\nZuzim = zûzîm = roving creatures [root: to be conspicuous, fulness of the beast, a moving creature] <br>\n-Ham = ham = hot, sunburnt, <br>\nEmim = 'êmîm = terrors, [root: fright, concrete, an idol (specifically the bogie man)] <br>\n-Shaveh = šāvê = plain, level plain, that makes equal [root: to level, to equalize, to resemble, to adjust] <br>\n-Kiriathaim = qiryāṯayim = two cities, [root: flooring, a building] <br>\n*Taken together Ashteroth Karnaiam is something like two horned Ashtoreth, or maybe shining light of Ashtoreth, or Ashtoreth of the twin peaks, or even Ashtoreth the powerful. Ether way the city was named to honor the false goddess of fertility. Taken together Shaveh Kiriathaim is two cities of the plain or identical twin cities. So, in the 14th year the four kings of the Babylon area decide to go to war. These are 3 cities that were attacked by the kings on their way to the five cities including Sodom and Gomorrah. \n\n###Verse 6\nHorites = ḥōrî = cave dweller, troglodyte, [root: cave, cavity, socket, den, hole] <br>\nSeir = śēʿîr = hairy, shaggy, rough [root: shaggy male goat] Hitchcock’s: harry, goat, demon, tempest<br>\nEl = 'ayil = strength<br>\nParan = pā'rān = place between caverns [root: to gleam, embellish, boast] Hitchcock’s: beauty, glory, ornament<br>\n*Taken together El Paran is the strong place between the caves. This is two more places in the area that were attacked nobody knows where these places were some people place them south of the dead sea with Seir between the dead sea and the eastern arm of the red sea and Paran closer to the west arm in the V of the red sea. The clue we have is that they are near the wilderness and the wilderness is likely the area that Moses and the Israelites will wander for 40 years. This plus the route that makes more since for the 4 kings of the Babylon area to follow, makes me think that El Paran is right at the tip of the eastern arm of the Red Sea almost directly south of the likely Mount Seir location. Remember however, nobody really knows where they were so we can only speculate. These were more people attacked by the Four kings of the Babylon area.\n\n###Verse 7\nTurned Back = šûḇ = to turn back, to retreat, again, return (but not always to the starting point) <br>\nEn = ʿayin = an eye, a fountain, a spring<br>\nMishpat = mišpāṭ = a verdict or judgement, sentence or formal decree, divine law, <br>\nKadesh = qāḏēš = sanctuary, place in the desert [root: sacred person, male temple prostitute for an Idol] Hitchcock’s: holiness<br>\nAmalekites = ʿămālēqî = people of lapping, descendants of Amalek [Amalek is dweller in a valley] <br>\nAmorites = 'ĕmōrî = a sayer, publicity, prominence [root: to say]<br>\nHazezon = ḥāṣaṣ = to chop, to sever, to distribute, to divide [root: a piercer, an arrow] <br>\nTamar = tāmār = to be erect, a palm tree, Hitchcock’s: palm, palm-tree<br>\n*Some translate Kadesh as holy; however, it is an idol sanctuary not in connection with the LORD God of Israel. In fact, Psalm 29 is a psalm by David about the holiness of the LORD. And in verse 8 it specificly separtes the “holiness” of Kadesh from the Holiness of the LORD. The verse says that the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. -Taken together ʿên mišp̄āṭ is the spring of judgement (Hitchcock’s: fountain of judgement), the eye of law, maybe today we would say something like big brother is watching. -Taken together ḥaṣṣôn tāmār is dividing the palm tree, or sever something that stands erect. Hitchcock has these taken together as “drawing near to bitterness”. -This verse says that the four kings of Babylon area turn back to attack the Amalekites and the Amorites. Amalekite’s location En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh) is pretty clear. But there is a lot of divergence as to where they went next which is also why nobody really knows where Sodom and Gomorrah are. One school of thought places Hazezon Tamar on the west side of the dead sea. And then they place the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other three also along the dead sea as you head north. From what I can tell this seems to be the most popular view but the confidence level of the scholars placing Hazezon Tamar around that location ranges from 45% at the most all they way down to 10% depending on which specific location in the area and which scholar you look at. The other idea which seems a little less popular happens to be the one I like. That is rather than finding the location of Hazezon Tamar, we instead look at where the Amorites lived. They lived east of the Jordan river between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. I like it because the place near the dead sea is dead. It may have been better in the past but the dead sea is like the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The water salts the land around it and makes it unusable. Also, if you go to the mountain where Abram and Lot (Genesis 13:3) stood at a place between Bethel and Ai. From that location you cannot see most of the dead sea but you can see the plain of the Jordan Valley north of the Dead Sea, which was very fertile ground. Also, when you get to Numbers 21:13 and 20 it talks about how the Israelites went to the top of the mountains of Pisgah in the area between the Moabites and the Amorites and look down to see a wasteland. This is the same mountain Moses climbs to look at the promise land. Deuteronomy 34:1 says this is across from Jericho.  Also, if you look at archeological evidence found in the plane east of the Jorden (across from Jericho) there is a 5-foot-thick layer of charcoal, ash, melted bricks and melted pottery. Bricks melt at 2700 degrees or hotter. Scientist found no impact craters so they concluded it would have had to be an Icy body from space that heated from friction with the atmosphere and got up to about 3600 degrees and exploded in the air causing everything below it to be burned and melted they said that this also vaporized some of the water from the Dead Sea causing a layer of salt to cover the area making it an uninhabitable wasteland for the next 600 years. Wonder how Lot’s wife became a pilar of salt?\n\n###Verse 8\nBattle = milḥāmâ = a battle, a war<br>\nSiddim = śidîm = field, plain, flats<br>\n*The kings of the 5 cities of Sodom and Gomorrah area go out to battle with the 4 kings of the Babylon area.\n\n###Verse 9\nFour = 'arbaʿ = four [root: sprawling on all fours, to be four sided] <br>\nFive = ḥāmēš = five<br>\n*The Bible seems to repeat itself a lot the benefit of that is it limits confusion and prevents arguments as to what is happening.\n\n###Verse 10\nPit = bᵊ'ēr = pit, well [root: to dig, to engrave] <br>\nAsphalt = ḥēmār = bitumen (tar pit) [root: to boil, to ferment, to glow, to smear with pitch] <br>\nFled = nûs = vanish away, escape<br>\nFell = nāp̄al = to fall, to lie (great variety of applications) <br>\nRemainder = šā'ar = to swell up, to be redundant, to remain, be leftover<br>\n*The word pit is written 2x for emphasis which is why it is translated as “full of” pits. -So the 5 kings of the Sodom and Gomorrah area are defeated and flee to the mountains.\n\n###Verse 11\nThey took = lāqaḥ = to take (wide variety of application) <br>\nGoods = rᵊḵûš = property, goods [root: to lay up, to collect] <br>\nProvisions = 'ōḵel = food [root: to eat] <br>\nWent their way = yālaḵ = to walk, to carry<br>\n*The winners took the spoils of war and started heading home.\n\n###Verse 12\n*Here we discover that Lot is taken as part of the spoils of war. Seems like some of the goods the 4 Kings of the Babylon area took were slaves.\n\n###Verse 13\nOne who escaped = pālîṭ = refugee, fugitive [root: to slip out, to escape, to deliver] <br>\nHebrew = ʿiḇrî = one from beyond, an Eberite (descendant of Eber) <br>\nDwelt = šāḵan = to reside or permanently stay [root: to lie down] <br>\nMamre = mamrē' = strength, fatness, lusty [to rebel, to whip, flap the wings] Hitchcock’s: rebellious, bitter, set with trees<br>\nEshcol = 'eškōl = cluster, Hitchcock’s: bunch of grapes<br>\nAner = ʿānēr = boy [root: from the age of infancy to adolescence, a servant (male or female)] Hitchcock’s: answer, song, affliction<br>\nAllies = baʿal = master, owner, lord [root: to be master, to marry] <br>\nAllies = bᵊrîṯ = covenant, contract, compact [root: to select, to feed] <br>\n*Eber is in Genesis 11:14-17 he is the son of Salah and the father of Peleg in the section of the genealogy to Jesus that goes from Shem (Noah’s son) to Abram. Eber means from the region beyond or one that passes. -We have come across 3 different words now that are translated dwell. One when Abram goes to dwell in Egypt for a time, this one means to stop of the road and carries a tone of fear of a new place. Two when Abram returns to the promised land to Dwell, this one means to sit down and has the idea of settling down in a place more permanently. Three here we see Dwell is from a word meaning to reside permanently with the root of a place to lie down. -Two words come together to form the idea for the English word allies. They are Master and Covenant, I think the idea is that two masters joined in the bond of a covenant means they are allies. -Seems to me like the Hebrews equate trees with strength\n\n###Verse 14\nHeard = šāmaʿ = hear, to understand<br>\nTaken captive = šāḇâ = to transport into captivity<br>\nArmed = rîq = to pour out, to empty<br>\nTrained = ḥānîḵ = initiated, practiced, tried, trained, experienced, trusty [root: to narrow, to initiate or discipline] *this is the only place this word is used in the entire Bible<br>\nBorn = yālîḏ = born [root: to beget] <br>\nHouse = bayiṯ = a house or household (wide application) [root: to build] <br>\n318 is written as Eight ten three hundred<br>\nHundred = mē'â = hundred, 1/100, also used as part of another number like in this case<br>\nEight = šᵊmōnê = eight, surplus or plumpness [root: greasy, fat, rich, robust, gross] <br>\nPursuit = rāḏap̄ = to run after (usually with hostile intent) chase, pursue, persecute; used figuratively as time gone by<br>\nDan = dān = judge [root: to rule, to judge, to strive] Hitchcock’s: judgement, he that judges. <br>\n*The word translated as armed means to empty out, so it seems to me like Abram took every available man he could. -The word for trained seems to have the connotation that they may have been trained in combat or at least know how to fight, even if it was just fight dangerous animals to defend the flocks. -Notice that the 318 trained men are born in Abrams household this gives some idea as to how wealthy Abram was. Abram takes his trained men and goes after lot. Dan is north of Lake Huleh which is north of the Sea of Galilee\n\n###Verse 15\nDivided = ḥālaq = to apportion, to separate, to smooth, divide, share<br>\nNight = layil = twist away (of the light), night; figuratively adversity<br>\nHobah = ḥôḇâ = hiding place [root: to secrete, withdraw or hide], Hitchcock’s: love, friendship, secrecy<br>\nDamascus = dammeśeq = silent is the sackcloth weaver, Hitchcock’s: a sack full of blood, the similitude (something that looks like) of burning<br>\n*Abram splits his forces and attacks in the night presumably in Dan. Then the 4 kings of Babylon area flee to the area of Hobah. People don’t exactly know where it is but everyone agrees that it is within a certain area. Notice the meaning of the word a hiding place. So, this may not be a city at all and may just be the place that the 4 kings tried to hide, which would explain why nobody knows exactly where it is.\n\n###Verse 16\nPeople = ʿam = a people, a tribe, troops, attendants; figuratively a flock<br>\n*Abram saves lot and all the stolen goods. Bible doesn’t really say if Abram killed the kings or if they just hid while he took Lot and all the goods back, I personally think the latter.\n\n###Verse 17\nMeet = qārā' = an encounter, accidental, friendly or hostile<br>\nValley = ʿēmeq = a vale, open country [root: to be or make deep] <br>\nShaveh = šāvê = plain, level plain [root: to level or equalize to be even], Hitchcock’s: the plain, that makes equality<br>\n*Valley of Shaveh is a valley that is about ¼ of a mile from Jerusalem. This is where Abram brought everything back to and where the king of Sodom went to meet Abram.\n\n###Verse 18\nMelchizedek = malkî-ṣeḏeq = my king is sedek, my king is right or King of Right, Hitchcock’s: king of justice. This is a compound word King and the right (Natural, moral or legal) <br>\nKing = meleḵ = King, royal [root: to reign, ascend to the throne] <br>\nSalem = šālēm = Peace, peaceful [root: complete, friendly, safe, at peace] Hitchcock’s: complete or perfect peace<br>\nBread = leḥem = food, especially bread made from grain [root: to feed on, to consume, to do battle]\nWine = yayin = to effervesce (fermented bubbly drink), wine<br>\nPriest = kōhēn = one officiating, a priest, an acting priest (layman) [root: to meditate in religious services, to officiate, to put on regalia (robes of office)] <br>\nGod = 'ēl = strength, mighty<br>\nMost High = ʿelyôn = the supreme, lofty, elevated [root: to ascend, to mount, to climb] <br>\n*Here we are introduced to Melchizedek or King of Righteousness (which simply means the King who does the right thing). Notice here that he is a “priest of God Most High”, this is important. Also see that this is the King of Salem aka Jerusalem.\n\n###Verse 19\n Blessed = bāraḵ = to kneel, to bless God or God bless man, also can be used as a euphemism meaning to curse<br>\nPossesor = qānâ = to erect, to create, to produce, to purchase, to own. <br>\n*Melchizedek blesses Abram and gives the glory to God\n\n###Verse 20\nDelivered = māḡan = to shield, to encompass, to rescue, to hand over safely, to deliver [root: a shield, a protector, scaly hide of an animal] <br>\nEnemies = ṣar = narrow, a tight place, pebble, an opponent [root: to cramp, suffer distress] [2nd root: a stone, a knife] <br>\nHand = yāḏ = a hand (indicating means of power) <br>\nGave = nāṯan = to give, put, set<br>\nHim = לוֹ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Vav, (learning connection or driving the nail) or 36<br>\nTithe = maʿăśēr = tenth part, tithe [root: ten, teen] <br>\n*The word translated as him, the one Abram gives the tithe to aka Melchizedek, I can’t help but notice that those two letters put together mean driving the nail. And if you believe in Biblical Numerology 36 would mean God Man. Biblical numerology is controversial and widely debated as to whether or not we as Christians should find this significant or not. I personally see that in certain limited instances Biblical numerology can support the plain text. So, I think it is possible that God placed significant numbers in specific places for a specific purpose like 666 for example; however, I would advise extreme caution when using Biblical Numerology. It can easily slip into the realm of heresy. Whenever I even consider mentioning it, I make sure that it lines up with what is already written and only verifies the word of God rather than giving some new hidden information. Whether you agree with it or not at a minimum you should know it exists so that if you are in a situation where it is brought up you will know where you stand on it and not be caught off guard. -Aside from all that, we see here that Melchizedek then blesses God Most High and praises Him a second time. Then Abram gives Melchizedek a tithe. This is the first time a tithe is given in the bible. So, who is this mysterious Melchizedek? Let’s look to the book of Hebrews chapter 7:1-4 for some more information. Melchizedek = King of Righteousness who is the King of Peace, King of Jerusalem, Priest of the Most High, Gives Abram Bread and Wine, gives all Glory to God Most High, receives a tithe of all Abram has, has no genealogy, has no Beginning and no End, is described by an untranslated Hebrew word with letters meaning driving the nail. So, who is Melchizedek? I believe Melchizedek is Jesus. Also note that throughout the Bible the King is in charge of certain things while the Priest is in charge of other things this is the first time where one person is given the title of King and Priest. Jesus also has both titles.\n\n###Verse 21\nMe = 'ănî = me, myself, I<br>\nFor yourself = לָֽךְ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Dalet, Goad and Door (push through the door) or learning humility, or 34<br>\n*Here we see the king of Sodom come to Abram hoping to get the people that were taken as slaves by the 4 kings. The king of Sodom says Abram can keep the goods, presumably as spoils of war or a reward for defeating the 4 kings. (34 Gods Creation)\n\n###Verse 22\nLifted up = rûm = to be high, to rise or raise, exalted<br>\nHand = yāḏ = a hand open indicating power<br>\nLORD = Yᵊhōvâ = Name of God, Yahweh, YHWH<br>\nMost High = ʿelyôn = an elevation high, as a title = the Supreme<br>\nGod = 'ēl = strength, mighty, used for both God and other deities<br>\nPossessor = qānâ = to erect, to create, to produce, to purchase, by implication to own<br>\n*Abram says he has put lifted his hand to the LORD. He is basically saying I have given my power to God\n\n###Verse 23\nThread = ḥûṭ = to sew, a string, thread, cord, line, can also be used to mean a measuring tape<br>\nStrap = śᵊrôḵ = Laced or tied sandal strap [root: to interlace] <br>\nSandal = naʿal = a sandal tongue, by extension a slipper, sandal or shoe<br>\nTake = lāqaḥ = take, accept<br>\nAnything = kōl = the whole, all or every [root: complete, perfect] <br>\nIs yours = לָֽךְ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Dalet, Goad and Door (push through the door) or learning humility, or 34<br>\nRich = ʿāšar = to accumulate, chiefly, to grow, rich<br>\n*Here we see that Abram is not only giving his power to the LORD but trusting Him to provide for Abram’s needs. (34 Gods Creation)\n\n###Verse 24\nExcept = bilʿăḏê = not until, except, without, besides [compound root: 1 a failure, nothing, not/ and 2 terminus, duration, perpetuity] <br>\nOnly = raq = leanness, limitation, merely, although<br>\nYoung men = naʿar = a boy or girl from infant to teen, or a servant<br>\nHave eaten = 'āḵal = to eat<br>\nPortion = ḥēleq = smoothness, also an allotment, portion, tract, territory [root: to be smooth (smooth stones used for lots to apportion or separate)] <br>\nAner = ʿānēr = boy, Hitchcock’s: answer, song, affliction<br>\nEshcol = 'eškōl = cluster, Hitchcock’s: Bunch of Grapes<br>\nMamre = mamrē' = strength or fatness, Hitchcock’s: rebellious, bitter, set with trees<br>\n*Except is a compound word really it is better translated as “Not Until” the first part means failure or not and the second part means duration or perpetuity so we have a compound word that is saying failure of forever which would convey the meaning of Not Until.- Abram returns all the spoils to the original owners taking nothing for himself except what was eaten by his men while they were out. It also seems there are 3 leaders, Aner, Eshcol and Mamre who took a portion for themselves or their group. Interestingly these seem to be the names of people here but are the names of places so it could be that Abram is naming groups of people by where they live and saying these groups can take a portion. Or maybe these were names of people that started those communities. I don’t really know for sure.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n7/4/2022\n",
      '15': "###Verse 1\nAfter = 'aḥar = the hind part, used as an adverb to mean behind or afterward [root: to loiter, remain behind or delay] <br>\nThings and The Word both = dāḇār = a matter spoken of, a thing or a cause [root: to arrange, to speak, to subdue] <br>\nCame = hāyâ = to exist, to become, come to pass<br>\nVision = maḥăzê = a vision [root: to gaze at, mentally perceive, contemplate] <br>\nFear = yārē' = Nervous fear, to cause fright, to be awed or morally revere<br>\nYour = לָךְ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Dalet, Goad and Door or Learning Humility or 34<br>\nShield = māḡēn = a shield, a protector, scaly hide of a large reptile [root: to hedge about, cover, surround, defend] <br>\nExceedingly = mᵊ'ōḏ = vehemence, muchness, force, abundance [root: rake or fire poker (for gathering embers)] <br>\nGreat = rāḇâ = to increase, become much, many, great<br>\nReward = śāḵār = payment of contract, salary, wages [root: a temporary purchase, to hire] <br>\n*Note: Yare is different from Yara from what I can tell Yare is very similar but seems to be more of a nervous sinking feeling in your gut verses butterflies in your stomach of Yara. Typically, Yare is used when the LORD says do not fear. While Yara is more often used when the Bible says Fear the LORD. -Abram has a vision where the LORD comes to speak with him. The LORD says that he is a great reward to Abram. Reward could also be translated as payment or wages. Looking at the next verse we see that Abram thinks the LORD is saying He will give Abram something. \n\n###Verse 2\nLord = 'ăḏōnāy = the Lord used in reference to God the Father only not other deities [root: to rule, sovereign, controller (human or divine) <br>\nGOD = yᵊhōvâ = Name of God, Yahweh, YHWH<br>\nChildless = ʿărîrî = bare, destitute [root: to bare, to demolish, strip oneself, lay bare] <br>\nHeir = mešeq = to hold, possession, acquisition<br>\nEliezer = 'ĕlîʿezer = God is help, Hitchcock’s: help or court, of my God<br>\nDamascus = dammeśeq = silent is the sackcloth weaver, Hitchcock’s: a sack full of blood, the similitude of burning<br>\n*Notice that in this verse it is written Lord GOD. Normally YHWH is translated as LORD but here it is GOD both are in all caps to indicate the name of the LORD. -Here Abram questions what the LORD will give him because he has no Heir of his own to pass on the gift.\n\n###Verse 3\nHeir = yāraš = to occupy, to seize, to rob, to inherit, to expel, to impoverish, to ruin<br>\n*The word translated to Heir in verse 3 is different from verse 2. Not sure why Abram uses 2 different words for this. In looking at the context it seems Abram is getting a little irritated and accusatory with GOD in this verse. While in verse 2 Abram seems to be more questioning. The word for Heir seems to be more harsh in verse 3 than in verse 2 so maybe it is just a ramping up of Abrams emotions. -Abram does not seem to fully trust the LORD at this point. He had faith enough to leave his home and go to the new land that GOD has given him; however, he seems to have trouble believing that Abram will have an uncountable nation come from him. (Genesis 12:2)\n\n###Verse 4\nBehold = hinnê = lo, behold, look, see [root: if, also (with expressing surprise)] <br>\nCome from = yāṣā' = to go out, bring out, come out<br>\nOwn body = mēʿê = literally means to be soft, used in plural to mean intestines, or internal organs<br>\n*Here we see the LORD reminding Abram of His promise. GOD spells out that Abram will have his own child as the Heir of the land given to him.\n\n###Verse 5\nOutside = ḥûṣ = to sever, to separate by a wall, outside, outdoors<br>\nLook = nāḇaṭ = to scan, look intently, regard with pleasure, look with care<br>\nHeaven = šāmayim = to be lofty, the sky<br>\nCount = sāp̄ar = to score with a mark, used as a tally or record by implication to inscribe or enumerate, to recount<br>\nStars = kôḵāḇ = a star, figuratively a prince, [root: to prick, to blister and possibly a second to give the sense of rolling] <br>\nDescendants = zeraʿ = seed [root: to sow] <br>\nBe = hāyâ = to come into existence, to become, to come to pass, [root: to breathe, to exist] <br>\n*There are two different words used meaning to look at something in verses 4 and 5. hinnê n verse 4 seems to be more about drawing your attention to something, while nāḇaṭ seems to be more about truly inspecting and studying something. -Word for “heaven” is the same word used in Genesis 1:1- Word for “be” here is the same word used for “be” when the LORD says “Let there be light” it is a word associated with GOD creating something. So, here we have the LORD telling Abarm that He will be creating Abram’s descendants and they will be an uncountable amount of people.\n\n###Verse 6\nBelieve = 'āman = to build up or support, to foster as a parent or nurse, figuratively to be firm or faithful, to trust or believe, to be permanent, morally to be true or certain, to turn to the right, take the right-hand road, to choose the right course of life<br>\nAccounted = ḥāšaḇ = to plait (similar to pleat means to braid material like hair or straw), to<br> interpenetrate (like weaving a basket), to weave, to fabricate, Figuratively: to plot, to contrive, to think, regard, value, compute, account<br>\nTo him = לּוֹ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Vav, (learning connection or driving the nail) or 36<br>\nRighteousness = ṣᵊḏāqâ = (abstractly) rightness, (subjectively) rectitude, (objectively) justice, (morally) virtue, (figuratively) prosperity<br>\n*There is a lot to unpack here, this is one of the most interesting words we have come across. First of all, this is the word used for faith in the LORD. This is the figurative meaning of the word. If you look at the literal meaning, 'āman means to build up or support. So, the word carries the idea that the LORD is the one who builds our faith. Second the word also has the idea of being raised by a parent or caregiver, to me this lends to the idea that faith is not merely build up by GOD but completely given by him. Third the word is about trust and belief but it is more than that, 'āman has the idea of permanence and certainty. So, we do not need to hope that the LORD will fulfill his promises we are certain of the fact. Fourth and most interesting to me is 'āman also has the meaning of choosing the right. So, this Hebrew word for faith has this idea that it’s not about having faith in just anything you want but faith in what is right. Remember GOD determines what is right and wrong so to me this is saying that if you believe really strongly that something will happen that is outside the will of the LORD then it doesn’t really count as faith. But true faith even the size of a mustard seed would be faith in what is right or faith in what is GOD’s will. Lastly, 'āman is pronounced very similarly to how Amen is pronounced in English. I wonder where our English word Amen came from? Amen in English means “let it be so” but I wonder if it came from the idea of this; “I have faith that it will be so”. - Accounted is also interesting, this is the first time this word is used as well. Being paired with the Hebrew word for faith, shows the idea of the LORD interweaving with Abram then saying Abram is Righteous. - Righteousness comes from GOD. If we look at Romans 3:10 quoting Psalm 14:3 and Psalm 53:3 we see that no one is Righteous, how can that be? Looking closer at the verses in Psalms, we see the Hebrew word here that Paul is quoting in Romans is “ṭôḇ” the word for good. Now if we look at Luke 18:19 we see Jesus say that only GOD is good. The Greek word for good here is “agathos” meaning: good in any sense. This is different that the word used in Romans 3:10, which is “dikaios” meaning: equitable, innocent or holy. Specifically, innocent meaning observing divine laws. So, even though different words here are used in these verses, it is clear that goodness and righteousness are very closely related. What we can see here is only GOD is inherently good and righteous and faith is the bridge. Faith in the LORD is used to interweave us with GOD in such a way that we can be accounted righteous. So, to put it another way, in order for us to be righteous we need to have the right relationship with GOD by trusting in the faith that comes from Him. \n\n###Verse 7\nChaldeans = kaśdîmâ = Clod-breakers (aka clodhopper or peasant), descendants of Kesed, an astrologer<br>\nInherit = yāraš = to occupy, to seize, to inherit<br>\n*Here we see the LORD reminding Abram that He fulfills His promises\n\n###Verse 8\n*Notice Abram is not quite there with GOD. So, he questions the LORD about his promise.\n\n###Verse 9\nHeifer = ʿeḡlâ = heifer, female calf that is nearly grown<br>\n3 years old = šālaš = to intensify, treble, to be triplicate (in portions or days or years), to divide into 3 parts, do a third time [root: 3] <br>\nFemale goat = ʿēz = she-goat, sometimes goats’ hair or young goat [root: to be stout, strong or harden] <br>\nRam = 'ayil = strength, hence anything strong, a chief, also a ram, a pilaster, and oak or other strong tree [root: to twist, be strong, the body, powerful] <br>\nTurtledove = tôr = a ring-dove, can be used figuratively as a term of endearment [root: a succession, a string, order, turn] <br>\nYoung pigion = gôzāl = a nestling, being nude of feathers [root: to pluck off, to flay, strip or rob, to tear away] <br>\n*In Hebrew this is written as “Speaking God bring me heifer triple goat(Kid) triple ram triple, turtledove, pigion(or young).” So depending on the context this could be GOD asking Abram to bring him 3 cows, 3 goats, 3 rams, a turtledove and a pigeon. But I think it more likely means bring a young cow, young goat, young ram and young dove. Looking at the meaning of “” translated pigeon it is saying a bird without feathers that’s a very young bird and notice that “” can mean 3 years old but can also mean 3 days old so GOD may be asking Abram to bring him a 3-day old cow, goat, ram and dove. Ether way in this verse the LORD is telling Abram to bring some animals.\n\n###Verse 10\nHim = לוֹ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Vav, (learning connection or driving the nail) or 36<br>\nCut = bāṯar = chop up, divide, cut in two<br>\nMiddle = tāveḵ = sever, bisection, the center, midst<br>\nPiece = beṯer = section, part piece [root: chop up, divide, cut in two] <br>\nOpposite = qārā' = encountering, accidental, friendly, hostile, adverbially used as opposite<br>\nThe other = rēaʿ = an associate, friend, companion [root: to tend a flock, pasture, graze]<br>\nBirds = ṣipôr = a little bird (as hopping) can be used for single or plural, [root: to skip about]<br>\n*Something I noticed that I want to keep an eye on as we go through this. So far, I have found 3 times where Lamed and Vav is used and translated as to him or unto him.  Its possible there are earlier instances but I wasn’t watching for them before now. What I noticed is that here in verse 10 the to him refers to GOD. While in verse 6 the to him is referring to Abram. While both are Lamed Vav the one in verse 10, referring to GOD, has no accent dot in the center of the Lamed while the one in verse 6, referring to Abram, does have the accent mark. If we look back at the 3rd instance it is found in Genesis 14:20 the to him is referring to Melchizedek and has no accent mark, just like the one here referring to GOD. I don’t want to draw any conclusions now but I will keep a watch on this. \n\n###Verse 11\nVultures = ʿayiṭ = Hawk or other bird of prey<br>\nCarcases = peḡer = a limp carcass, corpse, used for man or beast also figuratively used for an idol [root: to relax, become exhausted or faint] <br>\nDrove away = nāšaḇ = to blow, to disperse<br>\n*It’s always interesting to me to see how the LORD will used us. GOD could easily have provided the animals or immediately come down once the animals were divided, but He does not. We need to always be careful when speculating about why GOD does what he does; however, I wonder if the LORD is having Abram keep the birds away from the carcasses as a way of allowing Abram to take part in, and be committed to, the process.\n\n###Verse 12\nThe sun = šemeš = to be brilliant, the sun, by implication the east, figuratively a ray<br>\nDeep sleep = tardēmâ = a lethargy, or by implication trance or deep sleep [root: to stun, stupefy with sleep or death] <br>\nHorror = 'êmâ = fear, fear of something concrete or imagined like the boogie man. This fear carries the idea that you need to run or escape from something. <br>\nDarkness = ḥăšēḵâ = literally darkness, figuratively misery, death, ignorance, sorrow, wickedness [root: to be dark, to darken] <br>\n*Darkness is interesting here it is the same word as the word for darkness used in Genesis 1:2 \"ḥōšeḵ\"; however, it has a slightly different spelling. What I am seeing is that they are the same word but with different spelling. Not sure why they say that but it is possible they are different words with different meanings and we just lost the exact meanings over time. Regardless of that, we see that the word can be used to mean darkness literal while figuratively it has a more sinister feel. And we also see that this darkness caused a type of fear in Abram where he felt he needed to run and escape. Now this is just my speculation but if we look at what is happening in this passage the LORD is sealing his covenant or contract with Abram. Normally when signing a contract, it is clear what you gain from the deal but it is also clear what you will you will miss out on. I wonder if the LORD is showing Abram the darkness that he would be in without GOD. Misery, destruction, death, ignorance, sorrow, wickedness all things that happen when we are without GOD. \n\n###Verse 13\nKnow = yāḏaʿ = to know<br>\nCertainly = yāḏaʿ = to know<br>\nStrangers = gār = a guest, by implication a foreigner<br>\nServe = ʿāḇaḏ = to work, to serve, to till, to enslave<br>\nAfflict = ʿānâ = to depress, to be occupied, busied with<br>\n* Know and certainly are the same word written twice for emphasis.- Here we see the LORD giving a prophecy about when Israel will be slaves in Egypt. I believe this promise is given for the people to know that when they are in Egypt, they should not lose heart GOD has not forgotten them. Notice a couple things the LORD talks about Israel staying as a guest and also as slaves and being afflicted. If we look to Exodus 12:40 we see that Israel was in Egypt for a total of 430 years and at first Joseph was second in command of the entire country. Israel is given the best of the land; however, from this verse we can see that they were only guests for about 30 years the rest of the 400 years they are in slavery.\n\n###Verse 14\nJudge = dîn = to rule, to judge, to strive or contend with<br>\n_____ = kēn = set upright, done correctly, just, rightly, so, honest<br>\n*The LORD also foretells that he will judge (Egypt) for what they have done and that Israel will leave with a lot of stuff. We see this come true in Exodus 12:35-36. The LORD is basically saying I will judge and deal with Egypt correctly.\n\n###Verse 15\nPeace = šālôm = safe, well, happy, friendly, welfare, health, prosperity, peace, completeness, soundness [root: to be safe, to be completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate, to be sound<br>\nBuried = qāḇar = to inter, bury<br>\nOld age = śêḇâ = having grey hair, old age<br>\n*Looks like there is more to the word Salem than peace. Safety, happiness, prosperity, completeness; so, when we see Melchizedek as the king of Salem it seems there is more there.- The LORD now lets Abram know that he will not be alive during the time of the slavery of his descendants.\n\n###Verse 16\nGeneration = dôr = revolution of time, an age, a generation, a period, can also mean a dwelling [root: to gyrate (move in a circle), to remain, or dwell, to heap up or pile] <br>\nHere = hēnnâ = hither or thither (used for place or time) {hither and tither are words that mean to move toward this or that, place or time.} <br>\nIniquity = ʿāôn = perversity, evil, fault, iniquity, mischief, punishment<br>\nComplete = šālēm = to be safe, to be completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate, to be sound<br>\n*We now have two more words that could be translated as dwell, to list them all 1. Stop off by the road with fear 2. Sit down 3. Lay down 4. Stay for a time 5. Move in circles going nowhere. All are different aspects of dwelling in a place.- Normally we think of a generation as about 20 years so how could there be 4 generations while the Israelites are in Egypt if they were slaves for 400 years. Remember people lived a little longer back then, the bible does record 4 generations in the family of Levi and the fourth generation is Moses himself which would have them leaving the land of Egypt in the fourth generation. They are Levi 137 years, Kohath 133 years, Amram 137 years, and Moses 120 years (Exodus 6:16-20 and Deuteronomy 34:7). If we look at Exodus 7:7 we see that Moses was 80 years old when he first confronts Pharoah. If we look at Exodus 12:40 then we see that the Israelites were in Egypt for 430 years. Some quick math 137 + 133 + 137 + 80 = 487 – 430 = 57 so this means that Levi was 57 years old when he went to live in Egypt and the first 30 years they were treated as shepherd kings but were afflicted for the next 400 years. And on the fourth generation they left Egypt when Moses was 80 years old then dying 40 years later just before the children of Israel enter the promised land.  Another interesting thing we see at the end of this verse is the section about the Amorites iniquity. The Amorites live right next to the promised land, maybe the LORD knows that if the Israelites were in the promised land during these 400 years, then they would have been attacked, corrupted or possibly destroyed. To me this is saying that the GOD sees the 400 years of slavery in Egypt as a blessing to the people. To me it looks like the LORD is protecting the Israelites from the iniquity of the Amorites.\n\n###Verse 17\nDark = ʿălāṭâ = to cover, dusk, thick darkness<br>\nSmoking = ʿāšān = literally smoke, figuratively can mean vapor, dust or anger [root: to smoke, to be angry] <br>\nOven = tannûr = a fire pot, stove [root: to glisten, a lantern or light] <br>\nBurning = 'ēš = fire can also be used figuratively to mean anger<br>\nTorch = lapîḏ = to shine, a flambeau, lamp or flame, torch<br>\nPieces gezer = something cut off, a portion, part [root: to cut down or off, to destroy, exclude, decide or divide] <br>\n*Now a smoking flame appears in the vision. Flame and smoke are often used to represent the presence of the LORD. Pillar of Fire and Cloud, maybe smoke cloud. The LORD then passes between the halves of the animals. In the ancient world this blood covenant was done to seal a contract typically used for land treaties. The two making the agreement would cut the animals in half and both light torches and walk between them together signifying that if ether were to break their word, then the what happened to the animals should be done to that person. Notice with the covenant between the LORD and Abram that it is GOD alone that passes through. The LORD takes the burden upon himself to uphold the covenant. Another thing we can gain from this is the idea that because it is impossible for GOD to be divided as the animals were, therefore it is equally impossible for the LORD to break his covenant.\n\n###Verse 18\nMade = kāraṯ = to cut, to destroy, to covenant (make an alliance or bargain by cutting flesh and passing between the pieces) <br>\nCovenant = bᵊrîṯ = a compact made by passing between pieces of flesh, covenant<br>\nEuphrates = pᵊrāṯ = fruitfulness, break forth, rushing river. <br>\n*Interesting there are two different words here that both point to a covenant being made by cutting animals. We see that the promise of the land is given to Abram and his descendants. \n\n###Verse 19\nKenites = qênî = smiths; Hitchcock’s: possession, purchase, lamentation<br>\nKenezzites = qᵊnizzî = descendant of Kenaz [Kenaz means hunter] so descendants of the hunter<br>\nKadmonites = qaḏmōnî = easterners; Hitchcock’s: ancients, chiefs<br>\n*Kenites live in the desert between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai the consensus is that these are also known as the Midianites.- Little is known about the Kenezzites they are not mentioned in Exodus or Joshua so it is presumed that they died out or dispersed and did not have an organized tribe anymore when the Israelites returned from Egypt. It’s believed they lived in some part of Arabia.- The Kadmonites inhabited the northeast part of Palestine likely between Palestine and the Euphrates.\n\n###Verse 20\nHittites = ḥitî = descendants of Heth or Cheth [Heth means terror] so descendants of terror<br>\nPerizzites = pᵊrizzî = belonging to a village, inhabitant of the open country [root: rural] <br>\nRephaim = rᵊp̄ā'îm = a giant, invigorating [root: to heal, mend or cure] <br>\n*Heth or Cheth is one of the many fear words. It specifically has the connotation of fear of being broken in any sense. Literally fear of the violent breaking of your body all the way to figuratively fear of breaking your spirit causing you do lay prostrate or bow down.- Hittites were a warlike tribe that lived in the area between the Euphrates and Damascus. Makes since that they would carry a name where people are afraid that they must submit or be broken by these people.- Perizzites were farmers that lived in the south and southwest of Carmel.- Rephaim these were the original inhabitants throughout the land of Canaan. They were scattered by the Moabites, the Ammonites and the Zamzummim. Some of them found refuge in Philistine. They were likely the ancestors of Goliath any may or may not be connected with the Nephilim, little is known of their origins.\n\n###Verse 21\nAmorites = 'ĕmōrî = a sayer<br>\nCanaanites = kᵊnaʿănî = zealous<br>\nGirgashites = girgāšî = dwelling on the clayey soil<br>\nJebusites = yᵊḇûsî = descendants of Jebus [Jebus means threshing place, Hitchcock: treading under foot or manger] so descendants of threshing place, or descendants of the manger<br>\n*Amorites lived in a very large section of the territory they are at the north end Mount Hermon all along the eastern side of the Jordan down to past the north end of the dead sea on the southern border. Some say they also a little north of the dead sea cross to the west of the Jorden and extend south of the dead sea on that side.- Canaanites lived near the Persian Gulf and then spread west all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. Occupied Palestine from the Taurus mountain chain and south to the area of the dead sea on the west of the Jordan.- Girgashites not really known for sure where they were some think in the middle of the Canaan some say west side some place them more north.- The land know as Jebus is a small area which included Jerusalem and in the valley of kings south to Jerusalem. Jerusalem was named Jebus and was controlled by the Jebusites until King David purchased the land from them and then built the temple on that site. There were a couple of battles between the Jebusites and Israel but they were never concurred. This is also the exact location where Melchizedek was king of. It is interesting to me that the area was called Jebus (remember this is a transliteration of what the word would sound like in English to me this sounds eerily similar to Jesus). It also interesting that they were not concurred by the Israelites but instead the land that the LORD chose for his temple to be build was purchased from Jebusites. This purchase is recorded in 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21:24,25. The story behind this is related to a lesser-known sin of King David where he takes a census of the people. The LORD sends a plague as punishment for the sin. The plague stops at threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The LORD directs David to erect an alter on that threshing floor. When David approaches Araunah about the threshing floor Araunah tries to give it to David but David insists that he must purchase the land. This is the site where the temple will later be built. The Jebusites did battle with the Israelites in Joshua 10 and 11 and Joshua did kill Adoni-zedek (father or lord of righteousness). From what I can tell from looking into this Melchizedek and Adoni-zedek may have been the title given to the King of the Jebusites and not necessarily the name of the people.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '16': "###Verse 1\nHagar = hāḡār = flight, Hitchcock’s: a stranger, one that fears<br>\n*Sarai has no children and feels the need to help GOD out.\n\n###Verse 2\nRestrained = ʿāṣar = to inclose, to hold back, to retain or restrain, can also mean to rule over<br>\nPerhaps = 'ûlay = if not, perhaps<br>\nI shall obtain children = bānâ = to build used both literally and figuratively<br>\n*Sarai knows that Abram is supposed to have children but at this point both Abram and Sarai decide to make that happen. To me, this feels like a weakness in the faith of both Abram and Sarai. \n\n###Verse 3\nTo him = לוֹ = No Strong’s reference, Lamed and Vav, (learning connection or driving the nail) or 36<br>\n*No accent dot and this him is about Abram so seems like the accent dot is not reserved for when addressing GOD.- So it seems that they gave the LORD ten years then decided they couldn’t wait any longer. Abram left for Canaan at 75 so this makes him 85 or possibly a little older depending on how long the trip took and whether or not the stay in Egypt is counted.\n\n###Verse 4\nConceived = hārâ = to be or become pregnant<br>\nMistress = gᵊḇereṯ = Mistress, Lady, Queen [root: master, lord] <br>\nDespised = qālal = to be light, slight, swift, trifling<br>\n*Notice what happens here Abram and Sarai try to “help out” the LORD and make a child for Abram. Sarai takes her servant and has Abram make a child with her. Now, Hagar, rather than being grateful or happy that her son will receive a great inheritance. She almost immediately starts thinking of herself as above Sarai and starts looking down on her.\n\n###Verse 5\nMy wrong = ḥāmās = violence, wrong, unjust gain [root: to be violent, to maltreat] <br>\nUpon thee = ʿal = above, over, upon or against<br>\nEmbrace = ḥêq = to inclose, the bosom<br>\nJudge = šāp̄aṭ = to judge or pronounce sentence, to vindicate or punish, to govern or litigate<br>\nBetween you = bayin = between, interval, space between, used as a conjunction for ether or<br>\nAnd me = bayin = between, interval, space between, used as a conjunction for ether or<br>\n*Couple things here first it seems to me there is another word that reminds me of English the word for an embrace with special focus of holding near the chest. Is “ḥêq” and this word seems very similar to the English word hug and the word basically means to hug.- Next it is hard to tell if Sarai wants GOD to judge between her and Abarm or between her and Hagar. Upon thee is translated from a word that simply means over or against. And the word for between is just listed twice at the end. Also, notice again that Sarai is upset because Hagar is looking down on Sarai. Look even at the word for Judge that Sarai uses it is a word that carries the idea of vindication or punishment. From what I can tell Sarai feels wronged by Hagar. We are not really given the details but we can guess that Sarai thought the arrangement would be something where she would still be the wife of Abram and maybe would adopt this new child into their family as an heir. But it seems that Hagar may have had a different idea. I surmise she is feeling like she should now be the new wife with Abram and this new family will be the beginning of a great nation. There is no more need for Sarai she is yesterday’s news.\n\n###Verse 6\nHand = yāḏ = a hand indicating means of power<br>\nAs you please = ṭôḇ = good, pleasant, agreeable, right, benefit, welfare<br>\nDealt harshly = ʿānâ = to look down on, to depress, to be occupied with, to humble, to afflict<br>\nFled = bāraḥ = to bolt, to flee suddenly<br>\n*Abrams response is she is your servant so you have power over her, but notice the word “ṭôḇ” translated here as “as you please” but it seems to have a slightly different feel when looking at that word. “ṭôḇ” means good, indeed it is the same word used by the LORD when He says His creation is good. So, it seems to me that Abram is saying to Sarai that you are still above Hagar she is your servant she cannot take your place even if she feels she should be above you. Abram then basically says do good. And Sarai then “deals harshly” with Hagar it seems like Sarai humbled or brought Hagar down to her proper place in the pecking order. And when Hagar flees it seems she flees immediately or suddenly so there was no time for them too cool down and try to figure out how they can work out a something that they can live with. It is also interesting that Hagar’s name means one who fears or flight.\n\n###Verse 7\nAngel = mal'āḵ = dispatch as a deputy, a messenger specifically of GOD, an angel or prophet, priest or teacher<br>\nFound her = māṣā' = to come forth, to appear, to attain, to find or acquire, to occur, to meet, to be present. <br>\nThe way = dereḵ = a road, figuratively a course of life [root: to tread, to walk, to string a bow, to march] <br>\nShur = šûr = wall, a region in the desert; Hitchcock’s: wall, ox, that beholds<br>\n*Shur is most likely in the Arabian desert near the north east border of Egypt, above the V area of the two upper wings of the Red Sea. People think the name was given because it was a protective wall build by Egypt to defend their border.- GOD sends out an angel to find Hagar.\n \n###Verse 8\n*The angel starts to change Hagar’s perspective by asking a question. You will notice that GOD and angels and the devil often use that tactic. In psychology in order to change someone’s mind about something it is least likely to work if you just walk up to someone and tell them what to do. Arguing to prove your point will also rarely work. Instead, you need to lead the person down a path that opens them to the possibility that they may want to reconsider their opinion. Then, give some new information for them to consider and allow the person to change their own mind. I think the LORD knows this about us and that is why so often we see Him and angels start with a question.\n\n###Verse 9\nSubmit = ʿānâ = to look down on, to depress, to be occupied with, to humble, to afflict<br>\n*Submit here is the same word used for when Sarai “dealt harshly” with Hagar. So the angel of the LORD is directing Hagar to go back and humble herself and allow Sarai to treat her the way she is.\n\n###Verse 10\nMultitude = rōḇ = abundance, multitude, greatness<br>\n*The angel then gives Hagar a promise that her descendants will be multiplied so she has no need to fear for the safety of her son. Hagar’s child (Ishmael) is the father of the Arabs “nomads”. The modern-day descendants of Ishmael are most likely the Muslims. The Muslims go on to claim that the son of promise is Ismael the first-born son, while, Isaac is not the son of promise. They believe that GOD had Abram take Ismael on the alter and because of that then the Promised land is actually given to the Muslims and not Israel. Hence constant war in the Middle east.\n\n###Verse 11\nWith child = hārê = pregnant<br>\nIshmael = yišmāʿē'l = God will hear; Hitchcock’s: God that hears<br>\nAffliction = ʿŏnî = depression, poverty, misery, affliction<br>\n*The angel comforts her by letting Hagar know that the GOD is listening to her\n\n###Verse 12\nWild = pere' = running wild, Onager, wild… (donkey) <br>\nPresence = pānîm = the face<br>\n*The angel goes on to tell her what her son and his descendants will be like. Muslims vs Israelites. Ismael is still in their face and has his hand against them. Yet another example that we can trust the word of the LORD.\n\n###Verse 13\nWho sees = rŏ'î = sight, looking, seeing used literally, also used abstractly can be a vision, used concretely a spectacle<br>\n*Hagar praises the LORD with her own title for who God is to her. He is the one who sees.\n\n###Verse 14\nBeer Lahai Roi = bᵊ'ēr laḥay rō'î = this is actually 3 words put together as follows below<br>\nBeer = bᵊ'ēr = pit or well<br>\nLahai = laḥay = living <br>\nRoi = rŏ'î = sight, looking, seeing<br>\nBered = bereḏ = hail<br>\n*So maybe will of him that lives and sees or well of the vision of life best guess on the location is about 12 miles west of Kadesh-barnea. Note with Idols the LORD constantly points out they do not live and do not see or speak or move so it would make since that Hagar an Egyptian would distinguish the living GOD as the GOD to lives and sees compared to the idols of the time that do not live an do not see.\n \n###Verse 15\n*Hagar heeds the will of the LORD returns home and names the son Ishmael as the angel told her to. \n\n###Verse 16\n80 = šᵊmōnîm = eighty, eightieth [root: eight] <br>\n6 = šēš = six, one more than the number of fingers on the hand [root: to be bright, cheerful, exult, rejoice] <br>\n*So, conformation that Abram was in the land for 10 years found in Genesis 16:3 when he took Hagar as a wife. He is 86 when Ishmael was born, remember he left his father’s house when he was 75.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '17': "###Verse 1 \n90 = tišʿîm = ninety [root: nine, nineth] <br>\n9 = tēšaʿ = nine, nineth [root: to gaze about for help, inspect, consider, be nonplussed or bewildered] the thought is that the root comes from the idea of being one less than ten so you are gazing about or bewildered because you want the full 10<br>\nOld = bēn = a son, builder of a nation, grandson, nation, quality, condition. <br> \nAlmighty = šaday = Almighty, with the idea of being self sufficient<br>\nBlameless = tāmîm = entire, integrity, truth, complete, sound [root: to complete, finished] <br>\n*13 years later the LORD appears before Abram again and tells Abram to be blameless or in other words be with completed integrity. \n\n###Verse 2\nAnd I will make = nāṯan = to give<br>\nExceedingly = mᵊ'ōḏ = muchness, vehemence, abundance (the word here is written 2x) <br>\n*The LORD is basically saying I gave my covenant and the blessing will be much more than you can imagine.\n\n###Verse 3\n*Abram bows low to worship and show proper respect to the LORD\n\n###Verse 4\nMany = hāmôn = a noise, sound, tumult, murmur, crowd, disquietude, roar, wealth, abundance [root: to make a loud sound, great commotion, rage, war, moan, clamor] <br>\n*We see that not only with Abram be the father of many people but of many nations. And we can see that he is because all Christians are grafted into his house so at some point before Jesus comes back then Abram will be the father of some in every nation.\n\n###Verse 5\nAbram = 'aḇrām = exalted father<br>\nAbraham = 'aḇrāhām = father of a multitude<br>\n*So here at 99 years old the LORD changes Abram’s name to Abraham. It is interesting that for the vast majority of his life his name is Abram yet everyone in the world refers to him as Abraham. To me this kind of gives a glimpse of GOD’s perspective. Many times, in the bible, we see GOD cares about the eternal. The LORD will often times allow people to go through earthly hardships in order to make an eternal change in the person. We should learn to think of things the same way. What matters is the eternal just like with the name Abraham we all know him by that name and forever will.\n\n###Verse 6\nFruitful = pārâ = to bear fruit<br>\n*The LORD elaborates on his promise to Abraham\n\n###Verse 7\nEstablish = qûm = to rise, stand up<br>\nGenerations = dôr = revolution of time<br>\n*The LORD lets Abraham know that the covenant is not only with him but with his descendants as well. Because we as Christians are grafted into the tree of father Abraham, the covenant of the LORD is made directly with us as well.\n\n###Verse 8\nStranger = māḡûr = temporary abode, sojourning place, dwelling place<br>\nEverlasting = ʿôlām = concealed, to the vanishing point<br>\nPossession = 'ăḥuzzâ = something seized, possession<br>\n*The LORD is seizing the land and giving Abraham and his descendants, for as far as they can see into the future. I think this idea of as far as you can see or to the \n\n###Verse 9\nShall keep = šāmar = to hedge about, guard, protect, keep watch, preserve<br>\n*This is our part of the covenant. The LORD could just do everything for us, however He wants us to be involved with the process. He is not only our God but we are His people.\n\n###Verse 10\nCircumcised = mûl = to cut short, curtail, (implication) to blunt, (figuratively) to destroy<br>\n*The LORD says that the circumcision of every male will be what his people will do for the covenant. \n\n###Verse 11\nBe circumcised = nāmal = become clipped, be circumcised, be cut off, languish, wither, fade<br>\nFlesh = bāśār = flesh, (by extension) body, person (euphemistically) Male genital organ [root: to be fresh or full] <br>\nForeskin = ʿārlâ = foreskin [root: exposed, projecting loose, uncircumcised] <br>\n*Circumcision is to be a sign that sets apart GOD’s people from everyone else.\n\n###Verse 12\nBought = miqnâ = a buying, a piece of property, the sum paid<br>\nMoney = kesep̄ = silver<br>\nForeigner = nēḵār = foreign, foreigner [root: scrutinize look intently] <br>\n*This is where the LORD says when the circumcision should happen. 8 days old is when the circumcision is to be performed. Medically there are two major clotting factors that are related to this, they are Vitamin K and Prothrombin. Vitamin K becomes available for use in babies by day 7 after birth. Prothrombin increases until it peaks on the 8th day at 110% of its total strength. After this it drops to 100% then stays at that. To me when we see things like this it adds evidence to support that the Bible is the word of our true creator.\n\n###Verse 13\n*Notice that this includes all people that will be living in this nation of Abraham’s descendants including outsiders that are purchased.\n\n###Verse 14\nUncircumcised = ʿārēl = exposed, projecting loose, uncircumcised<br>\nPerson = nep̄eš = a breathing creature, man or animal, vitality [root: to breathe, to be breathed on] <br>\nShall be cut off = kāraṯ = to cut, to destroy or consume, to covenant<br>\nBroken = pārar = to break up, to violate, frustrate<br>\n*This is where we see our end of the covenant, the circumcision is an outward sign of the LORD’s people. But it has much greater significance than merely a physical sign. If we look at II Colossians: 11-14 we see the meaning behind circumcision. The true circumcision is the circumcision of our sins by Christ. Christ cuts away our sinful human nature so that we can be made alive through the resurrection of Christ, by having our sinful nature nailed to the cross.\n\n###Verse 15\nSarai = śāray = princess<br>\nSarah = śārâ = noblewoman<br>\n*Now Sarah gets her name changed as well. This name change is very subtle blue letter bible has the new name Sarah as meaning noblewoman, but some still translate it as princess or possibly princess of many. I think the significance of the name change her for Sarah is to basically change her from a princess (young noble woman unmarried therefore without children) to Queen (Noble woman who is married and the mother of royal children). I am not sure this is the significance but it makes the most since to me based on what I have looked up.\n\n###Verse 16\n*The LORD is specifically including Sarah in the promise. GOD is telling Abraham that the child of promise will come from Sarah\n\n###Verse 17\nLaughed = ṣāḥaq = to laugh outright can be laugh in merriment or in scorn which implies mocking or to make sport of<br>\nHeart = lēḇ = the heart, used for feelings but more commonly used for the intellect, the will the inner man, the mind<br>\n*Abraham seems caught by surprise that he will have a child at 100 years old (remember he is currently 99) and it seems that Sarah is 10 years younger than him because she will be 90 when the child is born\n\n###Verse 18\nOh that = lû' = if, by implication it is a wish, I wish<br>\n*It seems that Abraham is having a hard time comprehending having a child in his and Sarah’s old age. Notice he fell over laughing. Abraham’s response in this verse seems to be Abraham telling GOD that the problem is already solved. We have Ishmael why don’t you just pass the blessing on to him?\n\n###Verse 19\nNo = 'ăḇāl = the idea of negation, nay, truly, yet<br>\nIsaac = yiṣḥāq = he laughs, laughter [root: ṣāḥaq = to laugh outright can be laugh in merriment or in scorn which implies mocking or to make sport of] <br>\n*Note the root word of Isaac is the same word used to describe Abraham’s laughter in verse 17. The LORD sets the record strait the child of promise will be Isaac\n\n###Verse 20\nPrinces = nāśî' = an exalted one, king or sheik, one lifted up, also can mean a rising mist<br>\n*The LORD will not forget his promise to Hagar as well. He assures Abraham that Ishmael will be blessed as well\n\n###Verse 21\n*The LORD makes clear that the child that the covenant will be with is indeed Isaac who will be born of Sarah. It seems that the LORD knew that a problem would arise between the nations of the two brothers and He wanted to make it very clear who the promise goes through. Isaac leads to the nation of Israel while Ishmael leads to the nation of Islam\n\n###Verse 22\nFinished = kālâ = to end, be complete, finished, accomplished, spent<br>\nWent up = ʿālâ = to ascend<br>\n*The LORD finishes his conversation with Abraham\n\n###Verse 23\nSame = ʿeṣem = a bone, by extension the body, figuratively the substance or selfsame<br>\n*Abram wastes no time in carrying out GOD’s will. And circumcises all his house\n\n###Verse 24\n*Abraham does not hesitate to include himself in the process. To me this points back to the meaning behind circumcision found in The book of Colossians. If we ever find ourselves indulging in sin we need to cut it away immediately, this is something that should not be put off until later.\n\n###Verse 25\n*Here we see conformation of Ishmael’s age.\n\n###Verse 26\n*The Bible often repeats concepts. I’m not sure why this particular passage is laid out in a way to be repeated but it seems that the LORD want this area emphasized and clear. \n\n###Verse 27\n*The LORD’s promise applies to everyone not just those who are physically descendants of Abraham\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '18': "###Verse 1\nLORD = Yᵊhōvâ = the existing one, self-existent or eternal, the name of GOD Yahweh<br>\nDoor = peṯaḥ = an opening, door or entry way<br>\nHeat = ḥōm = heat<br>\nDay = yôm = to be hot, day, can mean from sunrise to sunset or one sunset to the next, can be used as singular or plural<br>\n*Shortly after Abraham is given the promise the LORD appears before him.\n\n###Verse 2\nRan = rûṣ = to run, to rush<br>\nDoor = peṯaḥ = an opening, door, gate, entrance way<br>\nBowed = šāḥâ = to depress, prostrate, bow down<br>\n*Yet another Hebrew word that is similar to English “rûṣ” means to rush. So, we will want to keep track of the three that appear to Abraham. The thing to note is that one of them is YHWH himself, we know this because the Bible uses the name of GOD here. Some believe that this is an appearance of Jesus because he is the one, that we can relate to as GOD in human form. At this point it makes most since to me that if this is Jesus, rather than GOD the father, then this would be Jesus as fully GOD before taking on his full humanity. But that is speculation on my part and could be wrong.\n\n###Verse 3\nFavor = ḥēn = graciousness, subjectively, kindness or favor, objectively, beauty [root: to bend or stoop in kindness to an inferior, be gracious] <br>\nLord = 'āḏôn = to rule, sovereign, controller (human or divine) <br>\n*Abraham asks the three to stay with him, entertaining angels comes to mind\n\n###Verse 4\nLittle = mᵊʿaṭ = a little, a few <br>\nWash = rāḥaṣ = to lave, wash to clean, bathe, or refresh or sooth by washing<br>\nFeet = reḡel = a foot used for walking, by implication: a step, can be used to mean something that sticks out [root: to walk along] <br>\nRest yourselves = šāʿan = to support oneself, lean<br>\nTree = ʿēṣ = a tree that is firm, wood<br>\n*In modern English Abraham says take a load off I will get you some refreshments\n\n###Verse 5\nMorsel = paṯ = bit, fragment [root: to break apart or crumble] <br>\nRefresh = sāʿaḏ = to support, sustain, stay<br>\nBread = leḥem = food, especially bread or grain<br>\n*You can see the word for bread is “leḥem” and as a side note “beth” means house so Bethlehem is house of bread. Interesting that Jesus physical body was born in the house of bread. Abraham tells them food to be brought as well\n\n###Verse 6\nHurried = māhar = to be liquid or flow easily, by implication: to hurry, adverbially: promptly<br>\nMeasusres = sᵊ'â = a seah, or certain measure of grain. <br>\nFine = sōleṯ = to strip or chip off, flour<br>\nMeal = qemaḥ = to grind, flour<br>\nKnead = lûš = to knead<br>\nCakes = ʿugâ = ashcake, round cake of bread [root: to spin in circle, used as denominative: to bake] <br>\n*There is some debate however most say a Seah is equal to 1/3 of an ephah, and that a Seah is equal to the volume it takes to fill 144 eggs. Which calculates to somewhere between 9 to 14 liters depending on the size of the eggs. An ephah is equal to one bushel about 35 liters. So that would make a seah 11 and 2/3’s liters to be 1/3 of a bushel. Ashcakes are what they made then, these are bread made by burning wood to heat rocks then clearing away the ashes and placing the dough on the hot rocks then placing the ashes over the top to cook. Pronounced oog-gaw so these cakes must make people “Hooked on a Feeling”. In this time the grain they predominantly used for bread was Barley. Barley is 48 pounds per bushel. When grain is ground in to flour it cuts the size approximately in half, which means the weight of a Bushel of flour is about 96 pounds. The average person eats between 3 to 5 pounds per day so for easy math let’s say they eat one pound of bread for this meal then to get 3 Seahs and make bread means they were making 96 pounds of bread. Maybe they were making a meal for the entire house but verse 8 makes it seem like Abram stood and watched them eat. There may be another explanation that I think works better. First of all, it seems odd to me that Abraham would say get 3 Seahs of flour when he could have said get 1 Ephah. I think it is more likely that Abraham is asking Sarah to get 1/3 of a Seah. From everything I could find Ancient Hebrew did have a concept of 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 however, they did not have any words to describe fractional numbers. This is my own speculation but it makes since that if it was understood as 1/3 of a Seah then they would have made a 4-pound loaf of bread for the three travelers to eat. This along with milk, butter and meat from the calf would have made a large meal for the travelers. \n\n###Verse 7\nTender = raḵ = tender, weak, delicate, soft<br>\n*Notice multiple times in this section it says that Abraham hurried or ran. This is a good example for us that we should not keep the LORD waiting on us we should hurry to be in his service.\n\n###Verse 8\nButter = ḥem'â = curdled milk or cheese<br>\nMilk = ḥālāḇ = milk, fresh milk<br>\nStood = ʿāmaḏ = to stand, take a stand, tarry, delay, arise<br>\n*Abraham brings them food and stands by while they eat\n\n###Verse 9\nWhere = 'ayyê = where? <br>\n*The LORD inquires about Abraham’s wife\n\n###Verse 10\nCertainly = šûḇ = turn back, return, retreat again<br>\nReturn = šûḇ = turn back, return, retreat again<br>\nLife = ḥay = alive, raw, fresh, strong, living<br>\n*Sarah is listening at the door to the promise of the LORD. Now she hears that she will have a son\n\n###Verse 11\nOld = zāqēn = old [root: to become old] <br>\nAdvanced = bô' = to come or go<br>\nIn age = yôm = day, to be hot (as in the heat of the day) <br>\nPassed = ḥāḏal = to be flabby, by implication: desist, figuratively: be lacking or idle, cease<br>\nTo be = hāyâ = to exist, to become, come to pass, be<br>\nChildbearing = 'ōraḥ = a well-trodden road, a caravan, a way, a path<br>\n*This verse is interesting because you can really see that it is hard to convert ancient Hebrew to modern English. The English translation is correct as far as passing on the meaning but the way the ancient Hebrews say it is different. Rather than saying Sarah is old and advanced in age they say she is old and her days have gone away. Instead of she has passed the age of childbearing, they say she is lacking creation as is the pathway of women.\n\n###Verse 12\nLaughed = ṣāḥaq = to laugh outright (in merriment or scorn), by implication: to sport (mock) <br>\nWithin = qereḇ = the nearest part, the center, midst<br>\nGrown old = bālâ = to fail, by implication: to wear out, decay, become old<br>\nShall I have = hāyâ = to exist, to become, come to pass, be<br>\nPleasure = ʿēḏen = pleasure, luxury, delight<br>\nLord = 'āḏôn = to rule, sovereign, controller (human or divine) <br>\n*Eden is the same word as the garden of Eden with a slightly different infection but the same meaning Pleasure. Next look at the word for laugh, this is the same as the word used when Abraham laughed in Genesis 17:17. Notice that the word can be laughing in merriment or joy and can also be used for a scornful or mocking type of laugh. Normally when doing something good it is in the light or in full view of everyone while something bad is usually hidden away in the dark. When Abraham laughed about a child in his old age, he laughed out loud so hard that he fell over. While, Sarah laughed within herself hidden away. This plus the fact that later the LORD admonished Sarah for her laugh but did not do the same to Abraham is the reason why most believe that Abraham laughed with joy while Sarah laughed in mockery.\n\n###Verse 13\nShall = 'ap̄ = accession (something greater coming), also, yea<br>\nSurely = 'umnām = verily, truly, indeed, orthographical variation (the correct variant) <br>\n*The LORD calls out Sarah\n\n###Verse 14\nToo hard = pālā' = to separate, distinguish, to be or make great, difficult, wonderful, extraordinary<br>\n*The LORD says that He can do the things we think cannot be done\n\n###Verse 15\nDenied = kāḥaš = to be untrue in word or deed, deceive, be disappointing, fail, grow lean<br>\nAfraid = yārē' = fear, morally revere, to frighten<br>\n*Fear here seems to be about being afraid of something greater than yourself. From what I can tell this word is used very often by the LORD when he tells people not to be afraid of Him. Sarah feels this type of fear because the LORD knows her inner thoughts and tells her she is worng.\n\n###Verse 16\nLooked = šāqap̄ = to lean out, to gaze, overhang, look out and down<br>\n*Let’s follow the movements of the 3 men. At this point they look toward Sodom\n\n###Verse 17\nHide = kāsâ = to plump, fill up the hollows, by implication: to cover (for clothing or secrecy) <br>\n*The LORD decides to let Abraham know what will happen with Sodom\n\n###Verse 18\nMighty = ʿāṣûm = powerful, by implication: numerous<br>\n*The LORD confirms his promise to make of Abraham a mighty nation \n\n###Verse 19\nJustice = mišpāṭ = a verdict, judgement, sentence or formal decree, abstractly: justice<br>\n*It seems to me that the LORD is saying here that He is informing Abraham about Sodom and Gomorrah and their fate so that Abraham will be able to pass the story on to his children so they can be aware that sin is serious\n\n###Verse 20\nOutcry = zaʿaq = a shriek, outcry, cry of distress<br>\nSin = ḥaṭṭā'āṯ = an offence (sometimes used for habitual sinfulness), occasion or expiation, an offender [root: to miss] <br>\n*The people are crying out against the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. We often see that sin creates harm for people and causes a cry of distress. We can even look back to Genesis 4:10 and see that the blood of Able cries out to the LORD.\n\n###Verse 21\nI will go down = yāraḏ = to descend, causatively: to bring down, to come or go down<br>\nAltogether = kālâ = completion, completely, destruction [root: to end, finish, perish, complete] <br>\nAccording to the outcry against = ṣᵊʿāqâ = shriek [root: to shriek, proclaim, cry out] <br>\n*Seems to me that the LORD is telling the two who were with him to go down. -The word for cry here, from what I can tell by the passages the word in this passage seems to mean crying while the other word in the above seems to be cry. Not much different and I could be wrong but it seems to me that this is the distinction between the two Hebrew words. -The LORD is slow to anger and does not just jump into judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah. He seems to, or at least shows Abraham that He will, make sure that the cry against Sodom is true before taking action.\n\n###Verse 22\nTurned away = pānâ = to turn, by implication: to face, to appear or look<br>\n*”pānîm” is the face or in front of it seems like “pānâ” is to turn and face something. -So, following the movements of the 3 men that appeared before Abraham. Two went down toward Sodom while one (the LORD) stayed with Abraham.\n\n###Verse 23\nCame near = nāḡaš = to be or come near, draw near, approach euphemistically: to lie with a woman, as an enemy: to attack, religiously: to worship, causatively: to present, figuratively: to bring forward and argument, by reversal: to stand back<br>\nDestroy = sāp̄â = to scrape or shave, can be used for scraping together or scraping away<br>\nRighteous = ṣadîq = just<br>\nWicked = rāšāʿ = morally wrong, bad person, criminal<br>\n*I believe this is a third word that we translate to destroy in English. The others are found in Genesis 6:7 meaning to wipe away or smooth and Genesis 6:13 meaning to decay or ruin. -Here Abraham asks if the LORD will destroy all the people of Sodom and Gomorrah good and bad\n\n###Verse 24\nThere be = yēš = to stand out or exist, being, substance<br>\nSpare = nāśā' = to lift or carry<br>\n*Abraham asks the LORD about his intentions and if he will scrape them away or if the LORD will carry them for the sake of 50 rightous\n\n###Verse 25\nFar be it = ḥālîlâ = literal: a profaned thing, as interjection: far be it or forbid<br>\n*Abraham is asking the LORD if he would really kill the just and the unjust together, and so the bargaining of Abraham with the LORD begins.\n\n###Verse 26\n*The LORD begins by telling Abraham that when he looks at the people of Sodom that he will spare the city for the sake of 50 righteous people. This brings to mind the parable of the wheat and tares found in Matthew 13:24-30 and 36-43. Specifically in verse 29 it says that the tares should not be gathered up so as not to uproot the wheat. Tares being the wicked and wheat being the righteous, GOD does not want to uproot the righteous in order to remove the wicked. For example, if mother is not Christian but her child comes to Christ while a teenager, think of how negatively that would affect the child if the mother was uprooted early.\n\n###Verse 27\nHave taken it upon myself = yā'al = to yield, assent, show willingness, be pleased, used positively: to undertake as an act of volition, determine<br>\nAshes = 'ēp̄er = to bestrew (to spread out or sprinkle, or light weight scattering or blowing around), ashes<br>\n*Abraham approaches the LORD to discuss question Him and maybe strike a bargain. But notice that Abraham starts by letting GOD know that Abraham understands his place in relation to the LORD. It seems more like Abraham is having a respectful discussion with the LORD rather than arguing with him. By comparison if you want to see someone that seems more entitled or questions GOD then read the book of Job and you can see how the LORD responds. \n\n###Verse 28-33\n*Abraham starts my saying well what if there were only 45, would you still destroy the city for just 5 less. Through a back-and-forth conversation Abraham gets the LORD to say He will not destroy Sodom for the sake of 10. At this point many people look at this and say time out, I thought GOD was unchangeable how did Abraham change GOD? Indeed, if we look at Numbers 23:19 we see that GOD does not change his mind. This may seem to be the case however; we need to be careful to look at what the LORD actually said. He said in Genesis 18:26 that He will spare the city of Sodom for the sake of 50 righteous. He did not say no less than 50. He only said that if he finds fifty, he will not destroy the city. Notice that statement does not lock God in a box he can still say any number less than 50 and still say He will not destroy it for the sake of that new lower number. But even if there were 10 and the LORD did not destroy Sodom for the sake of 10 righteous then that does not mean that GOD changed, it is still true that GOD would not have destroyed Sodom for the sake of 50. Therefore, GOD did not change throughout that whole exchange even if on the surface it seems like He did.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible",
      '19': "###Verse 1\nAngels = mal'āḵ = to dispatch as a deputy, a messenger<br>\nGate = šaʿar = an opening, door or gate<br>\n*Again, following the movements of the three that Abraham met in the beginning of chapter 18. The LORD stayed to have a conversation with Abraham while the other two were sent down to Sodom. This is where we see the two come down to the city and they speak with Lot.\n\n###Verse 2\nTurn in = sûr = to turn off, turn aside<br>\nSpend the night = lûn = to stop (usually overnight), implication: to stay, lodge, pass the night, used in a bad sense: to be obstinate, to complain<br>\nRise early = šāḵam = to incline the shoulder to take a burden, to load up, also used for: to start early in the morning<br>\nOpen square = rᵊḥōḇ = a width, avenue or area, broad open place, plaza<br>\n*Notice that both Abraham and Lot treat the visitors in the same way. They are both very respectful, offer hospitality and wash the feet of the travelers. Lot also seems to have some urgency in what he is saying. He seems to be trying to get the strangers to the safety of his house quickly and have them leave early in the morning. The angles seem less concerned.\n\n###Verse 3\nInsisted strongly = pāṣar = to peck at, push, press, figuratively: stun, dull<br>\nFeast = mištê = drink, by implication: drinking, a banquet or feast<br>\nBaked = 'āp̄â = to cook, especially bake<br>\nUnleavened bread = maṣṣâ = sweetness, (bread not soured or bittered with yeast), an unfermented cake or loaf, elliptically: the festival of Passover<br>\n*Lot continues to urge them to stay with him until the angels agree to stay with him.\n\n###Verse 4\nNow before = ṭerem = to interrupt or suspend, adverbially: not yet or before<br>\nLay down = šāḵaḇ = to lie down (for any purpose) <br>\nSurrounded = sāḇaḇ = to revolve, surround, border, turn about, go around<br>\n*The relative safety is interrupted by the people of the city surrounding Lot’s house.\n###Verse 5\nKnow, carnally = yāḏaʿ = to know, used in a wide variety of senses<br>\n*Notice in the text that the word carnally is italicized this means the word is added more for context and understanding but is not actually written in the passage. We see that here. The only word written for this is a word that means to know but the word caries a very wide variety of uses so the people outside could merely be saying we want to see the newcomers. However, because of the context and what happens in the rest of the passage we know that the use of the word know in this passage is a much more nefarious meaning in this case which is why the word carnally was placed in this passage in English.\n\n###Verse 6\nDoor = deleṯ = something swinging, like a door<br>\n*Here we see Lot acting in the way a righteous person would. He is willing to place himself in a dangerous situation in order to separate the mob from some strangers he just met. Besides seeing Lot’s actions here there are some other ways for us to see that the bible considers Lot to be righteous. One of those is found in 2 Peter 2:7-8.\n\n###Verse 7\nWickedly = rāʿaʿ = to spoil, to make (or be) good for nothing, bad, be evil<br>\n*Lot knows what the people of Sodom are planning and asks them to stop being evil\n\n###Verse 8\nShadow = ṣēl = shade, shadow, (can be used literal or figurative) <br>\nRoof = qôrâ = a rafter, beam, by implication: roof<br>\n*And two verses later we see an example of the fact that man is not perfect. Even though Lot is considered righteous he is still fallible and offers his daughters to save himself and the strangers. Now it is easy for us to sit back and shake our head at Lot’s choice; however, we should consider the situation Lot is in. At this point he is in fear of his life and is also concerned that everyone in his house is in danger. It is important to note that even though we can explain and understand why Lot offered his daughters to save the rest of the people in the house, this does not justify his choice. \n\n###Verse 9\nBack = hāl'â = to the distance, far away, out there, onwards, further, also with time: thus far<br>\nBreak = šāḇar = to burst, break, break in pieces<br>\n*Here is another place where we see that Lot is not like the people that live in Sodom, they claim that Lot is acting as a Judge and they are tired of it. They plan to use violence to solve this.\n\n###Verse 10\n*Lot is saved by the Angels\n\n###Verse 11\nBlindness = sanvērîm = sudden blindness<br>\nWeary = lā'â = to tire, be weary, be impatient figuratively: to be or make disgusted<br>\n*The angels reveal that they do not need Lot’s protection but rather they will protect him from the coming judgement\n\n###Verse 12\nHere = pô = this place, here or hence, hither<br>\nSon-in-Law = ḥāṯān = a relative by marriage, (especially the daughter’s husband), figuratively: a circumcised child<br>\n*At this point the Angels tell Lot it is time to leave and that he should take anyone he cares about out of the city. Now remember what the Jesus said in Matthew 13:24-30 and 36-43. Earlier in we discussed that verse 29 specifically says that he does not want to uproot the wheat in order to get rid of the tares. I think this is an apt analogy because look at what is happening to Lot. The LORD did not destroy the Lot with the wicked. Instead, Lot will lose his house life as he knew it would change. In short Lot is uprooted from his entire life. Looking at the end of Genesis 18 we see that GOD would have spared the city for the sake of not uprooting 10 righteous. This gives us comfort even today, we who have faith in Christ, live in the surety that we need not fear the wrath of GOD. At worst we may be uprooted, but will not be destroyed. Rather, we will have eternal life in Christ Jesus our LORD.\n\n###Verse 13\n*Sodom will be destroyed but there is time for Lot and those he takes with him to leave\n\n###Verse 14\nMarried = lāqaḥ = to take (wide application) <br>\nSeemed to be Joking = ṣāḥaq = laugh outright in merriment or scorn<br>\n*Note this is the same word used for laughing when Abraham and Sarah both laughed in different ways.- The word translated to married has come up many times before but it is interesting that here the word is used for marriage. If we go back and look at Genesis 2:23b we see the first marriage in history and this same word “lāqaḥ” is used here. The current NKJV translation of this is, “She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.” But some of the words are placed out of order from the original text mostly because it would not make sense with English because of syntax. Rearranging the order to match the Hebrew it would be written “she shall be called woman because out of man was taken, she” both instances of she comes from the word “zō'ṯ” which means “this one”. Then we have the phrase “was taken” which is where we see “lāqaḥ”. It does mean “to take” in a very broad sense and as we see here Genesis 19:14 it can even be used to mean marriage. The whole phrase “out of man” is from the word “îš” which means man. Because is just a broad conjunction word. So, this section could very well be translated: “This one called woman, joined with man married to one”\n###Verse 15\nWhen = kᵊmô = as, thus, so, like, when<br>\nMorning = šaḥar = dawn [root: to be up early] <br>\nUrged = 'ûṣ = to be close, hurry, withdraw, press, be pressed, make haste<br>\n*Lot lingers throughout the night until morning. The angels basically tell Lot to just leave now with the people you have here.\n\n###Verse 16\nAnd while he lingered = māhah = to question, or hesitate, by implication: to be reluctant. <br>\nTook Hold = ḥāzaq = to fasten upon, to seize, be strong, to bind, restrain, conquer<br>\nMerciful = ḥemlâ = compasson, mercy, commiseration<br>\n*Sometimes it is hard for us to look at this story through Lot’s perspective. Imagine in one day 2 strangers come to your house to stay the night then that night they say get everyone you love and leave now because tomorrow a natural disaster is coming. Then most of your extended family won’t listen and as we will see later your own spouse is likely telling you to stay, ride it out, it can’t be that bad. So, Lot is reluctant to leave, now rather than the LORD abandoning Lot for his lingering. The LORD is merciful and takes Lot, and his immediate family, out of the city himself, because it seems that Lot does not have the strength to do it on his own. \n\n###Verse 17\nEscape = mālaṭ = be slippery, by implication: slip away, escape, causatively: to release or rescue, to bring forth young, emit sparks<br>\nLook = nāḇaṭ = look intently, by implication: to regard with pleasure, favor or care<br>\n*We have seen several Hebrew words that have been translated to look. This particular one has the idea of looking with pleasure, favor or care. So, we see it’s not just glancing back or looking toward Sodom as you are running away but rather desiring to return. Notice the angels say to get out of the valley. If we go back to the discussion on the heat required to vaporize a portion of the dead sea and create the layer of salt, we find archeologically in that valley then we can understand why the angels are so adamant about Lot and his family getting out of the valley. (to see my notes on that look at Genesis 14 verse 7 in the notes)\n\n###Verse 18 and 19\nMercy = ḥeseḏ = Kindness, goodness by implication: piety, subjectively: beauty, rarely by opposition: reproof or shame<br>\n*Lot says he can’t make it to the mountains.\n\n###Verse 20\nNear = qārôḇ = near, (in place, kindred or time) [root: to approach] <br>\nLittle one = miṣʿār = petty, short, a small thing<br>\n*Lot asks to go to a small city nearby instead of to the mountains\n\n###Verse 21\n*They agree to not destroy the small city\n\n###Verse 22\nHurry = māhar = to be liquid or flow easily, by implication: to hurry, adverbially: promptly<br>\nEscape = mālaṭ = be slippery, by implication: slip away, escape, causatively: to release or rescue, to bring fourth young, emit sparks<br>\nZoar = ṣōʿar = insignificance, little<br>\n*Interesting language difference instead of “Hurry, escape” its “be liquid and slippery”. Also note that the angels are waiting on Lot to get to the safe destination before they destroy the valley\n\n###Verse 23\n*It’s already the next day by the time Lot arrives in his city of refuge\n\n###Verse 24\nBrimstone = gāp̄rîṯ = cypress-resin, by analogy, sulfur [root: cypress wood] <br>\n*The word for rain is the same as normal rain but here we have fire and brimstone the brimstone is likely sulfur but could also be burning resin aka sap from a tree, or possibly both. Sulfur is solid like a stone but it does burn at about 350 Fahrenheit. Resin is a sicky substance that also burns at about 350. Water does not work very well to put out a fire from ether of these two substances. The stickiness of resin would mean that once the fire gets on something it would be difficult for it to be removed. Sulfur when it burns puts off Sulfur dioxide gas which becomes sulfuric acid when the gas comes in contact with water. This includes contact with any living thing. Neither of these would be very pleasant.\n\n###Verse 25\nGrew = ṣemaḥ = a sprout, growth<br>\n*The LORD even stopped the growth of things when he passed judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah\n\n###Verse 26\nPillar = nᵊṣîḇ = something stationary, i.e.: a military post, a statue<br>\nSalt = melaḥ = powder, specifically salt<br>\n*Why a pillar of salt? First one explanation for how she physically became a pillar of salt is that there is archeological evidence that something extremely hot fell into the dead sea and created vaporized salt water that left a layer of salt over the whole valley. This could explain how she became a pillar of salt. And at the same time we can see the divine intervention where Lot and his daughters are protected in the city of Zoar even though it was also in the valley. We can also look at the spiritual aspect. Look at Luke 17:28-33. Jesus uses Lot’s wife as an example of what it will be like when Jesus returns. It seems that Lot’s wife had the desire to live where she was and not follow the LORD’s will. On the day Jesus returns we need to not look back. Do not try to save your current life, instead, let go and follow Jesus.\n\n###Verse 27\n*Here we switch gears to Abraham’s perspective. He goes back to the same spot where he was speaking with the LORD in the previous chapter. The overlook where he can see the plain of Sodom and Gomorrah\n\n###Verse 28\nLooked = šāqap̄ = to overhang or lean out, gaze<br>\nSaw = rā'â = to see, can be literal or figurative<br>\nBehold = hinnê = lo! Behold<br>\nSmoke = qîṭôr = fume, cloud [root: to smoke for sacrifice] <br>\nFurnace = kiḇšān = smelting furnace [root: tread down, negatively disregard, conquer] <br>\n*We have 3 different words that are translated to look in English all in this one verse so I listed them above. The new words are for smoke and furnace. What I find more interesting that the words themselves are the root words of these. The root of smoke is a word that means sacrificial offering, and the root of furnace is a word that means to conquer. It is interesting that those are them meanings behind the words used to describe how GOD conquers and burns the plain of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n###Verse 29\nGod = 'ĕlōhîm = divine representatives of the supreme God, sometimes used for magistrates, rulers and judges<br>\nSent = šālaḥ = to send away, send for or send out (wide variety of applications) <br>\nOverthrow = hăp̄ēḵâ = destruction, overthrow [root: a turn, the reverse, the contrary, perversity] <br>\nOverthrew = hāp̄aḵ = to turn about, to turn over, by implication: to change, overturn, return, pervert<br>\n*Notice that the word for God here is elohim not YHWH. This implies that the two angels sent as agents to of the LORD were the ones who actually carried out the destruction and the sparing of Lot. -Also notice that two different but similar words are used here to describe what the LORD has done by passing judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah. To me both words imply the reversal of perversity, and this feels like an apt description of what is happening at this time.\n\n###Verse 30\nAfraid = yārē' = to fear, morally revere, causatively to frighten<br>\nCave = mᵊʿārâ = cavern (dark) <br>\n*Remember fear words in Hebrew typically describe a feeling. From context of usage and my own research this word seems to be describing the feeling of dread that you get when facing something greater than yourself. -The angels of the LORD tell Lot to go to the mountains. Lot says he can’t do it. But ends up going anyway. Using Lot as an example for how we should respond to GOD, there are a few interesting things. First of all, the LORD is faithful to his word and protects Lot even from himself. The LORD sent Lot to the mountains, but even though Lot went to a different place the LORD still spared Lot and the city of Zoar. So, it seems to me that the LORD will spare the city for the sake of one righteous. The LORD however, is willing to uproot one righteous. Notice that Lot is uprooted twice. First from Sodom and second from Zoar. Now if Lot had gone into the mountains the first time, then he would not have been uprooted a second time. The LORD is patient with Lot and allows him to decide, but ultimately the LORD’s will, will be done. Lot does go to the place where the LORD has sent him. We should use this example in our own lives to remember that it is always better for us to follow the LORD’s lead the first time.\n\n###Verse 31\nFirstborn = bᵊḵîrâ = eldest daughter, first born female<br>\nYounger = ṣāʿîr = little, insignificant, in number: few, in age: young, in value: ignoble<br>\n*Lot’s daughters say there is no other man on earth besides their father and decide to preserve the human race. The Bible never specifically says what happened to Zoar. Was the city spared or just a place in the city that Lot and his two daughters where hiding in. I believe Zoar was destroyed for 3 reasons. First Lot’s wife died while she was near the city but not in shelter. Second Lot was afraid for his life, because of the destruction going on around him, while he was in Zoar. Third Lot’s daughters believe that he is the last man on earth.\n\n###Verse 32-35\nNext day = māḥŏrāṯ = tomorrow, the morrow<br>\nLast night = 'emeš = time past, yesterday or last night<br>\n*The daughters decide to get their father drunk in order to get pregnant by him. Is what they did wrong? Yes, but only for one reason. Remember at this time the law of Moses was not given and people married family. In the time of Adam and Eve the people had to marry close relatives. They also had multiple wives. These things are debatable as to whether or not they are wrong. There is however another aspect to this and that is that Lots daughters get him drunk. Considering all the other factors this is probably where the sin would come in. Because the daughters decided to get pregnant by their father without his knowledge. In the daughters defense they were trying to preserve the human race with in their mind was the only option possible. However, they should not have tricked their father into this.\n\n###Verse 36\n*We have come across both these words before but I just noticed something interesting the word for conceiving a child is “hārâ”, the word for creating something is “bārā'” (Genesis 1:1), and the word for something coming into existence is “hāyâ”. All of these words seem closely related in sound and meaning. Not important for what is happening right now but I found it interesting. \n\n###Verse 37\nMoab = mô'āḇ = of his father<br>\n*Moabites came from this child, they lived to the east of Israel on the east side of the dead sea and the Southern portion of the Jordan out into the desert. They mainly worshiped the false deity Chemosh which required human sacrifice as part of the worship process. The Israelites clash with the Moabites several times and are enticed several times as will to set up “high places” and worship the idols of Moab. You may be wondering why this story of Lot and his daughters is even recorded at all in the bible. Probably the reason for this is that Lot and his eldest daughter, who were spared from the destruction of Sodom, are part of the line that leads to David and Jesus. Remember Ruth is a Moabite\n\n###Verse 38\nBen-ammi = ben-ʿammî = son of my people<br>\nAmmon = ʿammôn = tribal, inbred, my people<br>\n*Ben is son while Ammi and Ammon seem to basically mean the same thing. Another way to translate this would be “son of inbreeding”. This child becomes the father of the Ammonites. Same with these people they fought with the Israelites many times, but also at times the Israelites joined with them in worship of their false deity Molech (Aka Milcom). The root word of Molech is two parts that means to “rule with shame”. The worship of Molech was usually done by offering young children by fire. Some believe that the Moabite deity Chemosh is the same as Molech but with a different name in each culture, but less is known about Chemosh. Recently the Vatican has allowed a statue of Moloch to be placed in at the colosseum in Rome.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible",
      '20': "###Verse 1\n*We have seen all these words before. The story goes back to Abraham’s perspective and he leaves the area overlooking Sodom, after its destruction, going south to the place where Hagar ran to this is on the road to Egypt. It seems like this is Abraham’s modus operandi there may be trouble so let’s head over toward Egypt. The exact location of Gerar is unknown but it seems pretty clear it is ether in Egypt or near the eastern border of it.\n\n###Verse 2\nAbimelech = 'ăḇîmeleḵ = My father is king or Father of the king<br>\n*Abraham seems to fall into his old habits and tells the people of Gerar that Sarah is his sister. Apparently, as the bible says, Sarah is exceedingly beautiful, because at 89-90 years old Abimelech took Sarah. Took here is “lāqaḥ” same word we found earlier can be used to mean marriage as well as to take. \n\n###Verse 3\nDream = ḥălôm = dream [root: to bind firmly, be healthy or strong, by implication: to be plump, figuratively: to dream] <br>\nMan’s = baʿal = a master or lord, a husband, an owner<br>\nWife = bāʿal = to be master, to rule over, to marry<br>\n*The LORD warns Abimelech that he might be killed because he is trying to marry the wife of a master or lord.\n\n###Verse 4\n*No new words here but righteous is “ṣadîq” this means just. Abimelech says a couple of things here. First, he says I haven’t touched her. This is very significant because if Abimelech had touched Sarah this could bring into question the parentage of Isaac. Abimelech also seems to be aware of what happened in Sodom because he asks if God will slay his people, who are just, as well. \n\n###Verse 5\nIntegrity = tōm = completeness, integrity, figuratively: prosperity, morally: innocence<br>\nHeart = lēḇāḇ = the heart, inner man, mind<br>\nInnocence = niqqāyôn = clearness, innocency [root: to clean, be bare, aquit, be unpunished] <br>\n*Abimelech says that he is innocent and had no knowledge that they were married in fact Abimelech says that they themselves said they were brother and sister.\n\n###Verse 6\nWithheld = ḥāśaḵ = to restrain or refrain, by implication: to refuse, spare, preserve or to observe [root: to darken or withhold light] <br>\nSinning = ḥāṭā' = to miss, hence to sin or go wrong, by inference: to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, causatively: to lead astray or condemn<br>\nTouch = nāḡaʿ = to touch, reach, lay hand upon for any purpose, euphemistically: to lie with a woman, figuratively: violently strike<br>\n*Notice that God does confirm that Abimelech did not know that Sarah was married. And God prevented Abimelech from touching her in order to preserve his promise. \n\n###Verse 7\nRestore = šûḇ = turn back<br>\nProphet = nāḇî' = a prophet, an inspired man, spokesman<br>\nHe shall pray = pālal = to judge, by extension: to intercede, pray, intervene, interpose<br>\n*Repent means to turn around and go he opposite way. This is what God is saying here. Send her back and repent then Abraham will pray for Abimelech so he does not die. So, the question here is did Abimelech do anything wrong? Or even why is Abimelech being punished for what Abraham did? First, let’s take a closer look at Abimelech’s argument. One of his arguments is that he did not touch Sarah but we see, in verse 6, that is not because of Abimelech’s integrity but because the LORD prevented him from doing so. Abimelech also argues that Abraham and Sarah lied to him about their relationship. Even God confirms that Abimelech did not know that Sarah was married. However, did Abimelech go to Abraham and ask for Sarah’s hand in marriage? No, Abimelech just took her. To me this cry of innocence from Abimelech seems more like he was caught doing something and then cried innocence. Furthermore, the LORD is faithful to keep his promise by protecting Abraham from any retribution by Abimelech. God tells Abimelech in the dream you need to ask Abraham to pray for you so you don’t die. This would prevent Abimelech from acting on any perceived wrong by Abraham. \n\n###Verse 8\nIn their hearing = 'ōzen = broadness, the ear [root: to expand or give ear] <br>\n*Abimelech spreads the news to his people\n\n###Verse 9\nSin = ḥăṭā'â = an offence, sin, or sin offering<br>\nDeed = maʿăśê = an action, deed or work, good or bad, abstractly activity, by implication, a product or property<br>\n*Abimelech is upset with Abraham and says what have I done to you that you would bring this on me. Abraham should not have lied but Abimelech is not as guiltless as he claims to be\n\n###Verse 10\n*Abimelech continues the questioning by asking what did you see that caused you to do this\n\n###Verse 11\nFear = yir'â = the flowing of the gut, fear, morally revere<br>\n*Abraham answers the first question by saying that the people of Gerar did not fear, revere or love the LORD so he was afraid that they would kill him so he lied\n\n###Verse 12\nIndeed = 'āmnâ = surely, verily, truly<br>\n*Abraham then goes on to justify what he did by saying Sarah really is his sister or at least half-sister\n\n###Verse 13\nWander = tāʿâ = to vacillate, reel, go astray, err<br>\n*Abraham then answers the second question and tells Abimelech that He made a plan with Sarah at the time when GOD caused him to leave his fathers house. At that time, she agreed to say she was Abraham’s sister wherever they went. It is very possible that implemented this plan many more times than the two times recorded in the bible. It may be that these were the two times that were biblically significant because Sarah was taken by a powerful person in these two instances. In general, however they may have used this plan successfully, we don’t really know\n\n###Verse 14\n*So, Abimelech gives Abraham animals and servants\n\n### Verse 15 \n*He then says to Abraham stay wherever you want in my lands. Remember Abimelech knows that Abraham is supposed to pray for Abimelech so that he will not die. It seems to me that Abimelech wants to give gifts to Abraham to stay on his good side. As we will see later in verse 18 GOD has closed the wombs of the women in Abimelech’s house. This demonstration of power is enough for Abimelech to fear and revere the LORD so he wants to make sure that Abraham is happy\n\n###Verse 16\nThousand = 'elep̄ = thousand<br>\nVindicates = kᵊsûṯ = covering, to cover, figuratively: a veiling<br>\nThus she was rebuked = yāḵaḥ = to be right, prove, reciprocal, to argue, causatively: to decide, justify or convict<br>\n*Abimelech then points out how he is doing the right thing by covering Sarah and paying 1000 silver pieces to Abraham. For some reason that last word is translated as “Thus she was rebuked” to me it seems pretty clear that it was just Abimelech pointing out that he didn’t do anything wrong and that he was right in how he handled the situation\n\n###Verse 17-18\n17 Healed = rāp̄ā' = to mend, heal, figuratively: cure<br>\n18 Wombs = reḥem = the womb [root: be compassionate, to love through physical touch] <br>\n*Abraham does indeed pray for Abimelech and his household and GOD restores them\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '21': "###Verse 1\nVisited = pāqaḏ = to visit (can be used for hostile or friendly intent), attend, by anology: to observe, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit<br>\n*The LORD now fulfills his promise to Sarah\n\n###Verse 2\nIn his old age = zāqun = old age<br>\n*Sarah and Abraham are going to have the child of promise\n\n###Verse 3\nIsaac = yiṣḥāq = he laughs, laughter<br>\n*And Isaac is born\n\n###Verse 4\n*Abraham makes sure to fulfill the LORD’s command at the correct time\n\n###Verse 5\n*Here we have confirmation of our calculations that Abraham is 100 years old when Isaac was born, this would make Sarah 90, and Ismael 14\n\n###Verse 6\nLaugh = ṣāḥaq = laughter (in pleasure or derision) <br>\n*This is the same laugh word used in Genesis 17 for Abraham’s joy and 18 for Sarah’s mockery. But here we can tell by the context that Sarah is finally laughing with joy. This is another example of how I believe the LORD builds faith. The pattern is this, the LORD gives a promise, whether or not people believe His promise the LORD is faithful to fulfill his promise, then the faith of the people grow.\n\n###Verse 7\nSaid = mālal = to speak, utter, say<br>\nNurse = yānaq = to suck, causatively: give milk<br>\n*Sarah is amazed by the power of the LORD to restore an aged body and declares her praise to the LORD for his healing\n\n###Verse 8\nChild = yeleḏ = Lad or offspring, child, boy, youth<br>\nWeaned = gāmal = to treat as a person, benefit, by implication: to ripen or wean<br>\n*The child grows and Abraham celebrates with a great feast. Ancient Hebrews weaned their children between 18 months to 5 years old. This was cause for celebration because of the high infant mortality rate. If a child was able to make it to the point where they no longer need the mother’s milk then they were more likely to survive, and this was cause for celebration\n\n###Verse 9\nScoffing = ṣāḥaq = laughter (in pleasure or derision) <br>\n*And now we get to the point where our own sin comes back to bite us. Here we see that the older brother (age 15 to 19 depending on when Isaac was weaned) of Isaac is “scoffing” same laughter word yet again however from the context we can see this is the negative form of laughter\n\n###Verse 10\nCast out = gāraš = to drive out from a possession, to expatriate or divorce<br>\nBondwoman = 'āmâ = maid-servant or female slave<br>\nBe heir = yāraš = to occupy, by implication: to seize, to rob, to inherit, to expel, to impoverish, to ruin<br>\n*We have come across a couple of different words that are translated to “heir” we have seen this before but I wanted to point out the implications of “yāraš” it is the more negative inheritance that we have seen. This is more about seizing control of something, and not really about receiving a gift from family. Also note that Hagar is called a bondwoman rather than a wife. This is significant because it helps to underscore what Paul says in Galatians 4:21-31. When we read that section, we see the difference between being free in Christ or slave to sin and how we should desire to be part of the child of promise and not the child of flesh\n\n###Verse 11\nDispleasing = rāʿaʿ = to spoil, figuratively: to make or be good for nothing, bad, be evil<br>\nBecause = 'ôḏôṯ = turnings, on account of, cause<br>\n*Note here that the translation about Abraham’s displeasure comes from the word “rāʿaʿ”, this is the same word used to describe the wickedness of Sodom. Abraham seems worried that casting his son out in to the wilderness would be wicked\n\n###Verse 12\n*God then steps in and tells Abraham it is not wicked and he should listen to the desire of his wife Sarah for the sake of Isaac\n\n###Verse 13\n*God comforts Abraham by telling him, as he told Hagar earlier, that Ismael will be fine and will in fact become a great nation\n\n###Verse 14\nSkin of water = ḥēmeṯ = a skin bottle, waterskin<br>\nBeersheba = bᵊ'ēr šeḇaʿ = Well of an oath, well of the sevenfold oath<br>\n*Now that GOD has told Abraham that it is ok to send out Hagar and Ismael, Abraham gives them some water and sends them away to wander the wilderness\n\n###Verse 15\nPlaced = šālaḵ = to throw out, throw down, or throw away, fling, cast (can be used literally or figuratively) <br>\nShrubs = śîaḥ = shrubbery, a shoot, bush, plant<br>\n*Here we see that Abraham’s concern that it would be wicked to send them into the wilderness is well founded\n\n###Verse 16\nAt a distance = rāḥaq = to widen, be or become far, distant, recede, remove<br>\nBowshot = ṭāḥâ = to stretch a bow as an archer, hurl, shoot (only time this word appears in the bible) <br>\nBowshot = qešeṯ = bending a bow for shooting<br>\nDeath = māveṯ = death, the dead, figuratively: pestilence, ruin<br>\nWept = bāḵâ = to weep, to bemoan or bewail<br>\n*Things must be getting bad. They run out of water then she lays him under a plant for him to die. Furthermore, Hagar is very upset about the whole situation. To me this makes it seem like they have been out of water for a while and Ishmael is getting too dehydrated to continue\n\n###Verse 17 \n*Once again, the LORD keeps his promise even when Hagar forgets the promise given to her 15 to 19 years earlier. The promise to Hagar is recorded in Genesis 16: 11-12. As a side note the LORD is also fulfilling his promise that he just gave to Abraham in verse 14\n\n###Verse 18\n*The LORD now repeats to Hagar the promise that he gave to Abraham\n\n###Verse 19\n*God leads Hagar to water and she brings some to Ismael \n\n###Verse 20\nArcher = qaššāṯ = a bowman (only time this is in the bible) <br>\n*He learns to hunt an take care of himself\n\n###Verse 21\nParan = pā'rān = place of caverns, a desert in Arabia, beauty, glory, ornament<br>\n*Ismael grows up and walks like an Egyptian… I mean marries one\n\n###Verse 22\nAbimelech = 'ăḇîmeleḵ = My father is king or Father of the king<br>\nPhichol = pîḵōl = Strong, mouth of all, i.e. mouth of every tongue<br>\nArmy = ṣāḇā' = a mass of persons, figuratively: a mass of things, usually refers to being organized for war, or an army, by implication: a campaign, war or warfare<br>\n*Now we switch back to Abraham, where he is having a conversation with Abimelech and Phichol\n\n###Verse 23\nSwear = šāḇaʿ = to be complete, to seven oneself, swear<br>\nDeal falsely = šāqar = to cheat, be untrue, deal falsely<br>\nMy offspring = nîn = progeny, offspring, posterity<br>\nMy posterity = neḵeḏ = to propagate, offspring, progeny, posterity<br>\n*Something I came across with the word for swear it means to be complete, i.e. perfect, and another way to describe that is “to seven oneself” i.e. to complete oneself or to perfect oneself. This gives support to the idea of biblical numerology where the number seven carries the meaning of perfection. I am always back and forth on this so I thought it was interesting that a random word that we come across gives some support for the idea. But I guess that is the point of this study to see the Hebrew words and the meaning behind them. -We see here that Abimelech does not trust Abraham at his word. Once we lie and break someone’s trust it is difficult if not impossible to get that back. But we see that even Abimelech knows that he can trust the Lord. So, he asks Abraham to swear by God that he will not cheat Abimelech again as they deal with each other moving forward\n\n###Verse 24\n*Abraham agrees\n\n###Verse 25\nSeized = gāzal = to pluck off, to flay, stirp, rob or seize, to tear away<br>\n*Abraham then proceeds to immediately not hold back and tell Abimelech how he really feels. Abraham says a well was stolen from him. Notice in verse 23 Abimelech says don’t lie to me because of my “kindness” (that word can also be translated to mercy). This could be Abraham’s passive aggressive way of saying that he had to lie to Abimelech to protect himself. Whether or not it is, we see here that there is further evidence that Abimelech is well practiced at declaring how great he is, however his actions do not confirm what he says about himself, at least in Abrahams eyes\n\n###Verse 26\n*Abimelech seems quick to have verbal excuses. “I didn’t know”, “you never told me”, “this is the first I have heard of it”\n\n###Verse 27\n*Abraham and Abimelech make a covenant with each other. Using the same word for the covenant here as we discussed before. The word means to make a compact or covenant by passing between the pieces of flesh. So, they are making an agreement about the division of the land\n\n###Verse 28\nEwe lambs = kiḇśâ = a ewe, female sheep<br>\n*Abraham has set aside 7 female lambs, these were not used in the covenant ceremony\n\n###Verse 29\n*Abimelech inquires about the meaning of these set aside lambs\n\n###Verse 30\nYou will take = lāqaḥ = to take (wide meaning including marriage) <br>\nMay be = hāyâ = to exist, to be or become, come to pass<br>\nWitnesses = ʿēḏâ = testimony, witness<br>\nDug = ḥāp̄ar = to pry, by implication: to delve or dig, to explore or search for<br>\n*Abraham tells Abimelech that the 7 lambs are to witness the new covenant between the two about where the land borders are and specifically that the land (Beersheba) that contains the well is Abrahams\n\n###Verse 31\n*Beersheba wilderness is where Hagar was wandering. I don’t know if this is the same well that the LORD led Hagar to see or if she found a different well in the area\n\n###Verse 32\nPhilistines = pᵊlištî = immigrants, those who dwell in villages<br>\n*The well is returned to Abraham and Abimelech leaves to the land of the philistines. They live along the coast of the Mediterranean sea on the southwest corner of Israel. They currently live at least partially within the land that is promised to the children of Israel\n\n###Verse 33\nPlanted = nāṭaʿ = to strike in, fix in place, specifically: to plant<br>\nTamarisk = 'ēšel = a tamarisk tree, by extension: a grove of any kind<br>\n*Tamarisk is a word that comes from the Latin word tammis which means feather, or from a similar word in Spanish Tama meaning bird. The leaves on this tree are very small and light and resemble feathers. This makes them grow dense cover providing good shade cover. On top of that it secrets salt that attracts moisture from the dry environment causing a cooling effect under the tree. Some compounds in the tree can be used to synthesize two major neurotransmitters and can be used in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases. In Ancient times it was used to treat rheumatism, gout, asthma, and epilepsy. The tree is known as salt-cedar in the U.S. It produces edible fruit and the plant itself is used to spice many Indian dishes. It also produces a white sap that is high in vitamin B6 and used in many ancient medicine preparations. (Most of this info from small gardening basics .com) \n\n###Verse 34\n*One thing I noticed is that Abraham gets the well back under his control then plants some trees and leaves to go stay in the land of the Philistines with Abimelech. I just wonder why Abraham went to the work of making Beersheba a nice place to live to then leave the area and as far as I know, Abraham doesn’t come back here. We can watch to see if he comes back later but I wonder if he made Beersheba nice for his son Ishmael. Remember earlier in the chapter that when Hagar was sent out she came to this area and the Lord showed her a well that she used to save Ishmael’s life. Maybe Abraham secured the well from Abimelech because he wanted to make sure that Hagar and Ishmael would have a safe place to live?\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '22': "###Verse 1\nTest = nāsâ = to test, by implication: to attempt or try<br>\n*God calls on Abraham to test his faith. Something that I noticed here is that GOD waits until Abraham’s faith is ready for the test. The LORD has spent years growing Abraham’s faith until now the LORD knows that Abraham will pass the test\n\n###Verse 2\nOnly = yāḥîḏ = united, sole, one, solitary, by implication: beloved, lonely, can even mean “life” with the idea that life is not replaceable<br>\nLove = 'āhaḇ = to have affection for, love<br>\nMoriah = môrîyâ = chosen by Jehovah, seen by Yah (Yah is short for YHWH or Yahova), Hitchcock says: bitterness of the LORD<br>\nBurnt offering = ʿōlâ = a step, a holocaust (burning up in smoke), whole burnt-offering<br>\n*Moriah is mentioned only twice in the Bible first here and again in 2Chronicals 3:1. We see from chronicles that a mountain in Moriah is the place where the temple is built. We know there are several mountains in the area and we don’t know specifically which mountain the LORD showed Abraham. This is also the same general area where Christ was crucified. It is very possible, and in my mind, the exact location where Jesus was the perfect sacrifice for us. We will continue the discussion of this later. Only son is more about the idea that it is the son Abraham loves and cannot be replaced\n\n###Verse 3\nSaddled = ḥāḇaš = to wrap up firmly, bind up, figuratively: to stop, to rule<br>\n*Notice that here Abraham gets up early in the morning makes all the preparations and goes off. This is different from Lot who lingered, Abraham has no hesitation\n\n###Verse 4\nAfar off = rāḥôq = remote, distant, in place or time<br>\n*It takes Abraham 3 days to get to the place that the LORD shows him\n\n###Verse 5\n*To me this is the key verse of this entire section. Abraham tells his two servants to stay here while Abraham and Isaac go up to worship the LORD and that they will return when done. Abraham knows that he is going up to sacrifice his only son whom he loves. Then Abraham says we will come back. What happened? In chapter 20 Abraham was afraid to die, and his faith seems a bit shaky. Now, in chapter 22, Abraham has full confidence that Isaac will be fine. Well, what happened in chapter 21 grows Abraham’s faith. Isaac is born, in his parents old age, GOD fulfills his promise. Abraham knows he can trust, aka have faith in the LORD’s promises. Abraham also knows that the LORD made another promise. A great uncountable nation will come from Abraham through Isaac. Abraham knows that GOD will keep his promise so Isaac will be alive when they come back. We can look at Hebrews 11:17-19 for more insight as to what Abraham was thinking. Now, let’s continue to see what actually happens\n\n###Verse 6\nKnife = ma'ăḵeleṯ = something to eat with, i.e. a knife<br>\n*Abraham brings wood, fire and a knife. Abraham is fully committed to carry out what the LORD asks of him.\n\n###Verse 7\nLamb = śê = pushing out to graze, a member of the flock, sheep, and sometimes used for goat<br>\n*Isaac asks his father where is the lamb for sacrifice?\n\n###Verse 8\nWill provide for = rā'â = see, wide variety of applications one of which is to appear<br>\n*This verse could be translated as “God will see himself the lamb”, “God will appear himself the lamb” or “God will provide himself the lamb”. This is a powerful passage and shows the idea that some call a prophetic parallel. Prophetic parallel is the idea that the Bible will have events happen in a way that point to a future event. \n\n###Verse 9\nBound = ʿāqaḏ = to tie with thongs, bind (only time this is in the Bible) <br>\n*Abraham lays his son Isaac on the alter to be sacrificed. The interesting thing about this is that the entire countless multitude of the nation of Israel is represented in this one boy. And because we as Christians are grafted into that tree, we are all included in this. To me this represents the price for sin. We all deserve death as the price for sin.\n\n###Verse 10\nSlay = šāḥaṭ = to slaughter (in sacrifice), to beat<br>\n*Abraham is fully committed\n\n###Verse 11\n*Abraham is stopped by the calling of the angel of the LORD\n\n###Verse 12\nAnything = mᵊ'ûmâ = a speck or point, by implication: something or anything, with negative qualifier: nothing<br>\nAbraham has now demonstrated his faith in the LORD\n\n###Verse 13\nRam = 'ayil = strength, anything strong, politically: chief, also a ram, pillar, or strong tree<br>\nCaught = 'āḥaz = to seize, grasp, hold or take possession<br>\nThicket = sᵊḇāḵ = thicket, coppice <br>\nHorns = qeren = a horn (something projecting), by implication: a flask, cornet, by resemblance: an elephant’s tooth (i.e. ivory), a corner of the alter, a peak of a mountain, a ray of light, figuratively: power<br>\n*The LORD provides a substitute sacrifice for Abraham\n\n###Verse 14\n*The-LORD-Will-Provide is two words put together that we have seen before they are “Yᵊhōvâ” and “rā'â” which put together in its most basic form means the “LORD sees”. This section is what some would call a prophetic parallel were events that happen point to future events that will happen. So, let’s put this all together. Abraham is to take his only son, whom he loved; God also, took his only begotten son whom he loved. They wandered for 3 days, Jesus was in the tomb for 3 days. They went to the mountain in the land of Moriah, there is a decent chance that this is Golgotha. The LORD requires a sacrifice. If you think about it sin in essence is loving yourself more than the LORD, and sacrifice is a way of showing that you love the LORD more than whatever thing you are sacrificing. Isaac here represents all of the nation of Israel and through grafting all Christians. Isaac carried the wood that he would be sacrificed on and went willingly, Jesus carried the cross that he would be sacrificed on and went willingly. Isaac being placed on the alter for sacrifice to me symbolizes the cost for sin. The death of everyone is the requirement to pay for sin. However, look back to verse 8, the LORD will provide himself, and that is to me the final parallel. The LORD provides the sheep to save the life of Isaac. Sheep is a word that means strength, and it is caught by the horn which is word that means power. So, the LORD has bound the strength and power of the lamb. Jesus being fully man bound his strength and power to become the lamb. The LORD provides himself as a lamb to save all Christians\n\n###Verse 15\n*Now the LORD sends a message to Abraham\n\n###Verse 16\nSays = nᵊ'um = an oracle, utterance [root: to whisper, utter a prophecy, speak as prophet<br>\nBecause = yaʿan = heed, pay attention, purpose, adverbially: reason, cause, intention<br>\n*Now the LORD is telling Abraham that because he showed that he truly loves the LORD above all else the LORD will tell Abraham of the promise and blessings for Abraham’s faith\n\n###Verse 17\nStars = kôḵāḇ = A rolling and shining or blazing thing, a star, figuratively: a prince<br>\nSand = ḥôl = A whirling particle, sand, [root: whirl, dance, writhe] <br>\nSea = yām = to roar, a sea or large body of water, Mediterranean Sea, the west<br>\nShore = śāp̄â = the lip, by implication: language, by analogy: a margin or edge (i.e., shoreline) <br>\nPossess = yāraš = to occupy, by implication: to seize, rob, inherit, expel, impoverish, ruin<br>\nEnemies = 'ōyēḇ = hating, an adversary, to be hostile to<br>\n*There is a lot to unpack in this verse. First off, the verse starts with two repeated words. “Blessing” and “multiply” are both stated twice at the start of this verse. The LORD here is emphasizing the blessing and the increase that will happen to Abraham because of his faith. Next, we have some new words and a few we have seen once or twice before. Notice how stars and sand are very similar if you look at their basic meaning, they are things that whirl or roll around. Also look at sea and shore, sea means to roar, and while shore can mean margin or edge, the much more common meaning of that word is language. So, the LORD used words that can bring you to two ideas simultaneously. Abraham’s descendants will be numerous and will be moving and speaking. Lastly, we have the word we have seen before used for inheritance with the idea of seizing or taking it and this is used for taking the place of the enemy.\n\n###Verse 18\nBecause = ʿēqeḇ = a heel, the last of anything, also used for result, consequence or compensation<br>\nObeyed = šāmaʿ = to hear intelligently, (with the implication of paying close attention or obedience)<br>\n*The LORD makes it clear that the blessing come from obedience to the LORD. This to me reinforces Romans 10:17. Abraham is counted as having great faith for hearing. Not in one ear and out the other but carefully, with close attention and obedience. If we look at James 2:21-26 we can see that the obedience is an important part of expressing our faith. Another aspect of this that is important to note is that the LORD says all nations will be blessed by Abraham’s seed (AKA Jesus). The many of the Hebrew people took this to men that being Hebrew means they will have the blessing but it is clear that the blessing of Jesus is for all\n\n###Verse 19\n*So, now Abraham goes back to live in Beersheba where the well and trees are that he planted\n\n###Verse 20\nMilcah = milkâ = Queen<br>\nNahor = nāḥôr = snorting, snorer<br>\n*Now the bible starts to transition to Isaac growing up. It does so by looking at the family of Abraham’s brother Nahor\n\n###Verse 21\nHuz =ʿûṣ = wooded, council, woods, fastened\nBuz = bûz = contempt, despised, plundered\nKemuel = qᵊmû'ēl = raised of God, God hath raised up, God hath established him\nAram = 'ărām = exalted, the highland, highness, magnificence, one that deceives, curse\n*Nahor’s children\n\n###Verse 22\nChesed = keśeḏ = increase, gain, as a devil, as a destroyer<br>\nHazo = ḥăzô = vision, seer, seeing, prophesying<br>\nPildash = pildāš = flame of fire<br>\nJidlaph = yiḏlāp̄ = weeping, tearful, he that distills water<br>\nBethuel = bᵊṯû'ēl = God destroys, man of God, dweller in God, filiation of God<br>\n*More kids\n\n###Verse 23\nRebekah = riḇqâ = ensnarer, to clog by tying up the fetlock, fat, fattened, a quarrel appeased<br>\n*Bethuel and Rebekah, are part of the line to Jesus. Also note that Bethuel is the father of Laban also\n\n###Verse 24\nConcubine = pîleḡeš = concubine<br>\nReumah = rᵊ'ûmâ = elevated, raised, lofty, sublime<br>\nTebah = ṭeḇaḥ = a slaughter, massacre, murder, butchery, guarding the body, a cook<br>\nGaham = gaḥam = burning, to burn, flame<br>\nThahash = taḥaš = dugong (usually associated with the skin or leather from the animal), that makes haste, that keeps silence<br>\nMaachah = maʿăḵâ = oppression, pressure, depression, pressed down, worn, fastened<br>\n*The rest of the family\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n",
      '23': '###Verse 1\n*Sarah made it to 127, and she had Isaac at 90 years old. So, if we say today that people die of old age at around 100 then that would mean that Sarah was equal to about 71 years in today’s years if you want to think about it that way. But ultimately, she was 90 years old when she gave birth to Isaac in her old age. This would make Isaac 37 years old when his mother dies. One more detail is that 38 years later Abraham will die and be buried in the same place\n\n###Verse 2\nKirjath Arba = qiryaṯ \'arbaʿ = city of arba [root: Kirjath means flooring or buildings; Arba means fourth, or four] <br>\nHebron = ḥeḇrôn = association<br>\nMourn = sāp̄aḏ = to tear the hair and beat the breast, to lament, by implication: to wail<br>\n*Abraham was very sad at the death of his wife Sarah\n\n###Verse 3\nHeth = ḥēṯ = terror, trembling, fear<br>\n*Abraham goes to speak to some of the people that live in the area\n\n###Verse 4\nForeigner = gār = guest, by implication: foreigner<br>\nVisitor = tôšāḇ = dweller but not native or citizen, sojourner, resident alien<br>\nBurial place = qeḇer = a sepulchre, grave or tomb<br>\n*Abraham asks to purchase property as a burial ground, even this shows Abraham’s faith in the LORD’s promise. Rather than taking Sarah home to the family burial ground which would be the tradition at that time. Abraham chooses to bury her here because he knows this is the promised land and will be the new family burial ground\n\n###Verse 5-6\nChoicest = miḇḥār = select, best<br>\n*The people take Abraham to the best burial ground money can buy\n\n###Verse 7\n*Abraham seems very grateful to them\n\n###Verse 8\nHear me = pāḡaʿ = to impinge, meet, encounter or reach (could be by accident, on purpose or even with violence) <br>\nEphron = ʿep̄rôn = fawn-like, Hitchcock: dust<br>\nZohar = ṣōḥar = tawny, whiteness, Hitchcock: white, bright, dryness<br>\n*Abraham asks them to the right person to get the plot of land\n\n###Verse 9\nMachpelah = maḵpēlâ = double portion, a fold (as in two-fold or a group, not a wrinkle) <br>\nFull = mālē\' = full or filling, fullness, adverbially: fully<br>\n*This place seems to have an extra-large cave and Abraham wants to buy it for full price\n\n###Verse 10\nHittite = ḥitî = descendent of Heth, Hitchcock: one who is broken, one who fears<br>\n*Ephron comes to speak with Abraham\n\n###Verse 11\n*Ephron offers the cave and land to Abraham for free\n\n###Verse 12\n*Abraham is very grateful\n\n###Verse 13\n*Abraham insists on paying for the field\n\n###Verse 14-15\nShekel = šeqel = weight, specifically of a Hebrew coin<br>\n* Hebrew money was divided into these catigorieys, talent, mina, shekel, beka, gerah, pim, and kesitah. If we look at Exodus 38:25-26 we can find the relative value of a talent, shekel and a beka. 603,550 men each brought a beka (half a shekel) so this would be 301,775 shekels. Taking out the 1,775 shekels leaves 300,000 to be 100 talents so each talent must be worth 3,000 shekels. According to the Jewish Virtual Library (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/weights-measures-and-coins-of-the-biblical-and-talmudic-periods) there are 3 ancient weights found that are marked and can be weighed. Two that are marked one quarter shekel and another marked as a 5th. When weighing these and then converting to shekels we get 9.56 grams, 10.16 grams and 10.52 grams. Also, in the bible there are mentioned 3 different measurements for a shekel. Genesis 23:16 says the going merchants’ rate, Exodus 30:13 the sanctuary weight, and 2 Samuel 14:26 says by the king’s stone. So, there is no exact known weight for a talent. But those three average to 10.08 grams. An ounce equals 28.34952 grams. Prices of silver fluctuate all the time but on 12/11/2022 the price of silver is 75 cents for 1 gram. Making a shekel about 7 dollars and 50 cents. According to this calculation the plot of land that Abraham bought for 400 shekels is worth approximately three thousand dollars. However, as of today gold is worth $57.78 per gram. I have seen some sources say that in ancient times silver and gold had equal value and some even said sliver was more valuable than gold. This could mean the land was worth about $233,000. Looking at Roman records, in ancient times gold was 12.5 times more valuable than silver. This is from the time of Julius Caesar where there is a record of the value of silver to gold. Doing some math this would make the value of the land approximately $18,700. So, really while we can tell the relative value of things in the bible it is extremely difficult if not impossible to tell the value of those same things in today’s money. However, we do know that he says Abraham can have it for free so it seems like the smaller amount is more likely to be accurate to me\n\n###Verse 16\nMerchants = sāḥar = to travel around<br>\nWeighed = šāqal = to suspend a balance scale, weigh<br>\n*Abraham paid the 400 silver anyway\n\n###Verse 17\nSurrounding = sāḇîḇ = a circle, neighbor, circuit, around<br>\nBorders = gᵊḇûl = a cord, by implication: a boundary, by extension: the enclosed territory<br>\n*Abraham not only buys the cave but the entire field as well\n\n###Verse 18\n*This is an official transaction done in the sight of all so that no one can dispute it\n\n###Verse 19\n*Abraham is finally able to bury his wife\n\n###Verse 20\n*What is the point of this section? There are several theories out there about this passage let’s look at some of them.\n\n1. The Hebrew word “nāṯan” translated as give has a very broad meaning and could possibly be used for sell. If the word means sell throughout the passage, then this was a passage about price negotiation. The people that believe this theory usually say that the price was very high and that Abraham was pushed into it. Abraham asked to buy the cave but Ephron being a shrewd business man threw in the surrounding field as well so he could better justify the high price.\n2. Looking at the passage threw the lens of Hebrew lore and mystical texts this would be the same cave that Adam buried Eve in and while Adam was in the cave, he could smell the garden of Eden as if that is where it is located. After Adam buried Eve, he started delving deeper into the cave to find the garden but a voice told him to stop so he did and was also buried there. Later Abraham first encounters the cave when he is getting the calf for the meal for the 3 strangers that show up at his house. The calf runs into the cave and Abraham is so in love with the smell of the cave that from that day forward he visits the cave as often as possible but waits to buy the cave until he has a good reason like the burial of his wife so his purchase of the cave will not be suspicious.\n\n3. Abraham is a foreigner in the land but he knows that this is the land promised by GOD. Abraham realizes that he can’t just sit on his hands and wait for the LORD to give him the land. Abraham needs to take some responsibility on himself and at least buy something himself as a seed. This will forever give him and his descendants a legal claim to part of the land of Canaan. This way later when the land is given to the Israelites, they will have a legal right to the claim.\n\nNone of these really seem right to me. So, these are my own thoughts on this passage. It’s possible someone else out there thinks this as well, but I didn’t come across anyone who did. To me, this passage reminds me of 1Chronicals 21. Here, King David sins by taking a census of the people the LORD give David 3 choices as the punishment for the sin. David choses a plague of the LORD that will kill people for 3 days reasoning that GOD is merciful and may reduce the punishment. In verse 15 we see God does indeed end the disaster early. However, the LORD commands that an alter be built at Jerusalem. Then there is a section 1Ch 21:22-25 where the owner of the land of Jerusalem tries to give the place to David but David insists that he pays for the land and gives 600 shekels of silver for it and buys the place where the Temple will eventually be built in Jerusalem. The story in Genesis to me seems to point to the story in 1 Chronicles, and this in turn points to Jesus. There is a price for sin. In both these sections there is death and there is a price to pay. To me this shows that both Abraham and David show that their focus is not on earthly riches. Also, both of these seem to point to a greater promise of the LORD. And that faith in him will lead to something much greater than anything money can buy\n\nNote "*" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Blue Letter Bible\n',
      '24': "###Verse 1\n*Not sure how long after Sarah’s death this is but Abraham is 137 or older at this point and Isaac would be 37 or older\n\n###Verse 2\nThigh = yārēḵ = to be soft, the thigh, loin, shank, flank, or side, euphemistically: the generative parts<br>\n*Abraham gets the old servant that is in charge of Abraham’s entire household and says for him to place his hand (aka power) under Abraham’s loin. There are a couple of explanations for this and I think they are all aspects of why this is done. First placing the servant’s power (remember he has the power over Abraham’s entire household) here symbolizes that the oath is made on the promise of God that a nation will come from Abraham’s loins. Second, since circumcision is a sign of GOD’s covenant the servant is placing his power under God’s covenant. Finally, sitting on the hand reinforces that the servant will commit all his power to carrying out the task. We also see a similar oath made in Genesis 47:26 between Jacob and Joseph.\n\n###Verse 3\n*Abraham takes the oath even further, He has the servant swear by GOD, supreme God of heaven and supreme God of earth. This is really important to Abraham. Abraham does not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite. Maybe, this is because he does not want Isaac to be enticed to worship false gods. Maybe, it is because Canaan means humiliated and he does not want the nation of promise to come from the humiliated people. Maybe, because these are the descendants of Canaan the one cursed by Noah, Isaac’s very great grandfather, and Abraham does not want Isaac to marry into a cursed people.\n\n###Verse 4\n*So, the servant is to take a trip to Haran (Babylon area) across the desert to find a wife for Isaac\n\n###Verse 5\nWilling = 'āḇâ = to breathe after, figuratively: to be willing or consent<br>\n*The servant is trying to find the parameters of what happens if he can’t find a wife or she will not come back here\n\n###Verse 6\n*Abraham is very clear that he does not want his son to go to there\n\n###Verse 7\n*Abraham tells he servant that he is following the LORD’s will in this so he should not worry about things like what if the girl won’t come\n\n###Verse 8\nReleased = nāqâ = to be or make clean, by implication: to be empty or bare<br>\nOath = šᵊḇûʿâ = something sworn, oath or curse<br>\n*Abraham then says even if it doesn’t work out it’s ok just do not bring Isaac there\n\n###Verse 9\n*The oath is made\n\n###Verse 10\nMesopotamia = 'ăram nahărayim = Exalted of the two rivers or Highland between two rivers<br>\n*His journey begins, note that he brings 10 camels with him\n\n###Verse 11\nTo draw = šā'aḇ = to bale up water, women to draw<br>\n*The word here used for the camels kneeling is the same word that the LORD uses when he blesses someone.\n\n###Verse 12\nSuccess = qārâ = to light upon, encounter, meet, causatively: to bring about, specifically: to impose timbers<br>\n*Look at how the servant prays here. He prays to the LORD of his master Abraham. It doesn’t even seem like the servant thinks of the LORD as his own God.\n\n###Verse 13\n*The servant begins his prayer to the LORD\n\n###Verse 14\nYoung woman = naʿărâ = a girl from infancy to adolescence<br>\nPitcher = kaḏ = to deepen, properly a pail, generally clay jar<br>\nDrink = šāṯâ = to imbibe<br>\n*The servant gives a very specific requirement in his prayer to the LORD. This does a couple of things. First, it avoids any ambiguity as to who the LORD has chosen to be Isaac’s wife. Also, it would take a very kind and selfless person, to take the time and energy, in the busyness of that time of day, to stop and offer to draw water for the 10 camels depending on the source it looks like camels can drink anywhere between 20 to 53 gallons of water each in one sitting. Abraham’s servant asked to find someone willing to draw water for 10 camels without being asked to do so. The well back at that time is more of a pit that you walk down to get water at the base of then carry it back out. This seems to me like a task that would be very unlikely for someone to offer on their own. The prayer allows for the LORD clearly point out the woman who has been appointed for Isaac. \n\n###Verse 15\nBefore = ṭerem = to interrupt or suspend, used adverbially: not yet or before\n*Here is an example of how the LORD is willing to quickly answer prayers that are in his will. Remember in verse 3 above the LORD is the one who wants Isaac to marry someone from Haran. Abraham and his servant are faithful to follow the LORD’s will so when the servant prays to the LORD to help him fulfill what the LORD wants him to do then the LORD answers so quickly that Rebecca appears as an interruption to the servant’s prayer\n\n###Verse 16\nVirgin = bᵊṯûlâ = to separate, a virgin, sometimes bride, figuratively: city or state<br>\n*Beautiful here is from the word “ṭôḇ” which is the same word that the LORD uses when he says each day of his creation is good\n\n###Verse 17\n*Seeing the opportunity, the servant acts quickly to ask Rebecca for a drink\n\n###Verse 18\nQuickly = māhar = to be liquid or flow easily, by implication: to hurry<br>\n*So, this could read that she smoothly lowered the pitcher\n\n###Verse 19\n*Rebecca fulfills the criteria of the prayer so the servant knows that this is who the LORD has chosen for Isaac to marry\n\n###Verse 20\nTrough = šōqeṯ = watering-trough<br>\n*Rebecca runs back and forth to quickly bring water for the camels. Remember at that time a well was dug by hand so it was basically a large pit. She had to run down into the pit and carry out a jar of water over and over again for the camels. This would have taken some time for her to draw for the camels assuming the jar carries 5 gallons and the 10 camels each drink 20 gallons that would be 40 trips down to the water for the camels.\n\n###Verse 21\nWondering = šā'â = to stun, be astonished or gaze<br>\nSilent = ḥāraš = to scratch, by implication: to engrave, or fabricate, figuratively: to devise (this word can have the idea of devising in secrecy) i.e., to be silent, to let alone, so it can also be used to mean deaf<br>\nProsperous = ṣālēaḥ = to push forward, rush, advance, prosper, <br>\n*During this likely long time the man is speechless and amazed, because he is watching intently, to see if LORD really would work so quickly and clearly, to answer his prayer.\n\n###Verse 22\nNose ring = nezem = ring, usually nose-ring, sometimes earring<br>\nWeighing = mišqāl = weight, or the act of weighing, [root: suspend a balance scale] <br>\nHalf a shekel = beqaʿ = a beka, (coin weighing half of a shekel), also fraction or half<br>\nBracelets = ṣāmîḏ = a bracelet or arm clasp also used for a lid or jar cover<br>\n*From what I could find of the culture in that time period, a nose ring means modesty, and is also used in a similar way we use a wedding ring to symbolize marriage. Also, the weight in gold jewelry given showed wealth. So, he brings out the jewelry but does not give it to her yet.\n\n###Verse 23\n*Here we have Abraham’s servant asking for the second confirmation that she is the one the LORD has appointed. He asks what house she is from. He also asks if he can stay at her house. In this time and area of the world people often would stay at the house of someone. First of all, this was a harsh environment. So, it was always better to stay another’s house but it seems like sometimes people just had to sleep in the square. There weren’t really hotels or anything like that at the time\n\n###Verse 24\n*Rebecca says she is from the house of Nahor. The servant knows this is Abraham’s brother. And if you take another look at verse 7 above it could be interpreted as Abraham wanting Isaac to marry someone from his father’s house. This is the confirmation that the LORD is answering the servant’s prayer\n\n###Verse 25\nStraw = teḇen = material, specifically cut stalks of grain or straw [root: building material] <br>\nFeed = mispô' = fodder<br>\nEnough = raḇ = abundant, many, much, great<br>\n*So far, the Bible does not name this servant. But in looking up things about this passage many people name him Eliezer. This comes from Genesis 15:2, when Abraham asks the LORD if Eliezer will inherit his house. At that time a childless family would adopt an heir and they were usually the senior servant. So, this is why people assume the senior servant here is Eliezer. However, the bible does not name the servant in Genesis 24 and this is close to 50 years later than the time of Genesis 15. I personally think its better to not speculate here but if you come across a study that calls him Eliezer then you know why. She tells him that they have plenty of room for him and his entourage\n\n###Verse 26\nBowed down his head = qāḏaḏ = to shrivel up, contract or bend the body in deference, bow down<br>\nWorshiped = šāḥâ = to depress, prostrate, bow down (usually used to pay homage to GOD) <br>\n*This verse only contains 4 Hebrew words “Man” Shriveled” “Depressed” “GOD”. This is one example of why we need to be careful when translating Hebrew words to English. It would be easy for someone who didn’t understand the syntax and context of the passage to translate this verse as the man shriveling and depressing the LORD. But we can see that here the opposite is true the man is in such awe of how quickly and perfectly the LORD answered his prayer that he bent himself down to the ground before the LORD and worshiped him. To me this is one of the most important parts of this entire chapter. All too often when we get a prayer answered from the LORD we just think “that’s cool” and move on. Look at what happened in Luke 17:11-19. Sometimes we remember to say thanks, but how often do we shrivel up and lower ourselves prostrate on the floor in worship to thank the LORD for answering a prayer? I know in my own life I am much more likely to do something like that when I am asking for something rather than when I am thanking the LORD for something. Yet look at what this man did he asked the LORD for something, and when he did, he was standing up, and setting conditions on his request of the LORD. But when the LORD answered, verse 21 says, the man was stunned and silent. Then here, he crumpled to the ground in worship. I think this is a model of how we should interact with the LORD yet even as I write this, I have a hard time picturing myself follow through with this idea. I think this is something for me to pay more attention to how I interact with the LORD. One last thing to consider is the LORD cares about the heart so it seems that if in your heart you are bowing down and thanking the LORD then you could be doing this already.\n\n###Verse 27\nForsaken = ʿāzaḇ = to loosen, relinquish, permit, leave, forsake, loose<br>\nLead = nāḥâ = to guide, by implication: to transport<br>\n*This man is a faithful servant he is not praising the LORD for answering his own prayer but because the LORD is being good to his master Abraham\n\n###Verse 28\n*Rebecca runs ahead to warn her mother that unexpected guests are coming\n\n###Verse 29\nLaban = lāḇān = white, Hitchcock: white, shining, gentle, brittle<br>\n*Laban, her brother, gets the news and goes out to meet the guest\n\n###Verse 30\n*Laban finds him\n\n###Verse 31\n*Laban brings him back to the house and says that everything is ready for him\n\n###Verse 32\nUnloaded = pāṯaḥ = to open wide, to loosen, begin, plough, carve<br>\n*The man gets to the house and can finally rest \n \n###Verse 33\nSet = yāśam = to place, to be placed<br>\n*The servant says he will wait to eat until he can tell them about the news\n\n###Verse 34\n*He informs them who his master is\n\n###Verse 35\n*How the LORD has blessed him\n\n###Verse 36\nOld = ziqnâ = old age<br>\n*I think this may be the 3rd different word that we have come across that is translated to old age, but I don’t remember for sure. Abraham has a son Isaac\n\n###Verse 37\n*He is to the age where he should marry but he is not to marry a Canaanite\n\n###Verse 38\n*Isaac is to marry from his home country\n\n###Verse 39-46\n*The servant continues to reiterate what happened\n\n###Verse 47\nNose = 'ap̄ = the nose or nostril, hence: the face, occasionally a person, can also be used for anger (rapid breathing that flares the nostrils) <br>\n*This is not a new word but some translations say earring or simply ring. This verse points to the ring being a nose ring.\n\n###Verse 48\nTruth = 'ĕmeṯ = stability, certainty, truth, trustworthiness, faithfulness firmness<br>\n*There are three different words in this verse that basically mean to bow, they are “qāḏaḏ” bowed, “šāḥâ” worshiped and “bāraḵ” blessed. But they all three have slightly different meanings\n\n###Verse 49\nOr = 'av = shortened version of desire, so or<br>\n*To turn to the right or left. The right is the strong way by implication the morally correct way. The left is the dark way or the covered-up way.\n\n###Verse 50\n*Laban and Bethuel have an interesting response, rather than choosing they say they do not have a choice at all. They wholly believe that this is from the LORD and if the LORD chooses Rebecca, then they have nothing to say about it. Notice they do not praise the LORD so it feels to me like they do not want Rebecca to go but if the LORD chose her then they know they can’t do anything about it. It kind of reminds me of the saying “if you can’t say anything nice, then don’t say anything at all.” There are a few other times where this concept comes up the ones, I found are in Genesis 31:24, 29 and Numbers 24:13. There may be others but these are the two I found. \n\n###Verse 51\n*Laban is a manipulator (in my opinion) he is good at telling you what you want to hear then trying to bend the situation to what he wants. He has varying degrees of success at this. Here is Laban saying what Abraham’s servant wants to hear\n\n###Verse 52\n*Again, Abraham’s servant lowers himself to the ground and worships the LORD. To me this shows the servant’s heart. The servant doesn’t have to remember to thank the LORD but rather his heart is so focused on the LORD that the moment he hears the answer to his prayer, he immediately falls to the ground and worships the LORD, even though he just did that, he does it again. The servant’s heart seems to be continually focused on the LORD. Isn’t this how we all should be?\n\n###Verse 53\nJewelry = kᵊlî = something prepared, any apparatus (utensil, dress, vessel or weapon) <br>\nClothing = beḡeḏ = a covering, clothing, also used for treachery [root: to cover] <br>\nPrecious things = miḡdānôṯ = choice, excellent or precious thing, a gem<br>\n*So, this says the servant brought out things made of silver and things made of gold, coverings and precious things. Again, the servant is confirming the great wealth of his master Abraham and through inheritance Isaac\n\n###Verse 54\n*They have a celebration that night and in the morning the servant says it is time to go home\n\n###Verse 55\n*Here we see a glimpse into Laban trying to bend the situation closer to his will. Just last night Laban said take her and go. Now he says can’t you wait just 10 more days?\n\n###Verse 56\n*To me it seems that Laban did have the power to stop Rebecca from leaving. So, it seems like the offer to stay ten more days was not an offer or even a request but more of a command. There is no proof of what I am about to say but it seems to me like Laban may be thinking about not letting Rebecca go just yet, if at all. She is defiantly a hard worker, remember the camels, and Laban will attempt this same thing in the future. Maybe in Laban’s mind if he can get her to delay a while then she may have a change of heart and want to stay here this would put the servant in the position where Isaac would have to come here himself. And that is clearly against the wishes of the Abraham and the LORD. I think the servant suspects this and that is why he wants to leave immediately.\n\n###Verse 57\nAsk = šā'al = to inquire, by implication: to request, by extension: to demand<br>\nPersonally = pê = the mouth, the edge, portion or side, according to [root: to puff, blow away or scatter into pieces] <br>\n*Here we see that in English we get the feeling that Laban is innocently asking Rebecca if she would like to stay with her family for a few days. But when we see the words in Hebrew, we see that it is still a choice but with much less innocence to the question. The word used for ask means to ask but with the connotation of a demand that she stay. I think Laban is trying to keep his hard worker here. However, he is not willing to directly go against the LORD in this.\n\n###Verse 58\n*Ultimately, we see at least one more reason why the LORD chose Rebecca to be the wife of Isaac. She chooses to go immediately (possibly having to stand against pressure from Laban or temptation from the rest of her family to stay).\n\n###Verse 59\n*Rebecca goes with her nurse later in genesis 35 we see her name is Deborah. This leads to a discussion of why is Rebecca bringing her nurse how old is she? We have no real way of knowing exactly how old Rebecca is but there are a couple of reference points that allow us to make an educated guess. Some say she is 3 years old based on what some Rabbi Rashi and rabbis in the medieval era. They use Genesis 22 and this verse, that Rebecca has a nurse, to support this idea.  However, based on what Rebecca did in this chapter she is clearly not 3 years old. But we can use Genesis 21, 22, 23 and 24 to help us in finding an approximate age for Rebecca. In 21:8 Isaac is weaned and Abraham stays for many days in the land of the Philistines 21:34. After this (22:1) Abraham is told to sacrifice Isaac. In 22:5 Abraham refers to Isaac with the Hebrew word “naʿar” which means a male from youth to adolescence. Clearly Isaac is not 30 to 37 at this point as Rabbi Rashi suggests. What is a youth to adolescence according to the bible well we can see from Numbers 14:29 that the age of adulthood in the ancient Israelite people was probably 20 years old. So, at the point where Isaac was to be sacrificed, he was at most 19 years old. Now his mother dies when Isaac is 37 (verse Gen 23:1, and 17:17 with 17:21 and 17:24). After Isaac and Abraham return from the near sacrifice of Isaac (19 years old) Genesis 22:23 where Abraham hears that Rebecca is born. So, she must have been born before Isaac was 20 and 37-20=17. So, when we get to Genesis 24 where Abraham’s servant is meeting Rebecca after Sarah’s death. The youngest she could be is 17 and notice that in Genesis 24:14-15, Rebecca is referred to as “naʿărâ”, which means a female from youth to adolescence. Which would make Rebecca under 20 years old. Considering travel time, I think it most likely that Rebecca is at least 18 but for easy memory I think it is easiest to just remember that Rebecca is approximately 20 years younger than Isaac.\n\n###Verse 60\nThousands = 'elep̄ = thousand<br>\nTen thousands = rᵊḇāḇâ = multitude, myriad, abundance, a myriad<br>\nHate = śānē' = hate<br>\n*Rebecca receives a blessing\n\n###Verse 61\nRode = rāḵaḇ = to mount or to ride, causatively: to place upon, to dispatch<br>\n*Rebecca takes a group of people with her not just her nurse maid, who may be a mother figure to her, and they go\n\n###Verse 62\n*Isaac is living near the well that Hagar was at when she ran away it is near the border of Egypt\n\n###Verse 63\nMeditate = śûaḥ = to muse pensively, to think (only place this word is in the bible) <br>\n*Isaac is out in the field pondering as it is turning to evening and sees the camels coming\n\n###Verse 64 \n*Rebecca sees Isaac coming\n\n###Verse 65\nThis = hallāzê = this<br>\nVeil = ṣāʿîp̄ = to warp over, a veil<br>\n*When she hears that it is Isaac, she puts on a veil from what I can tell the veil is cultural and likely worn as part of the wedding ceremony\n\n###Verse 66\n*The servant reports to Isaac the events of the trip to find Rebecca\n\n###Verse 67\nComforted = nāḥam = to sigh, breathe strongly, by implication: to be sorry, pity or console<br>\n*Isaac and Rebecca marry\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

They used human sacrifice as part of their idol worship. Keder also became part of the Arabian tribes. The Muslims trace the genealogy of Muhammed through Keder to Ismael. Adbeel also became part of the north Arabian tribe residing southwest of the dead sea. Not much is known about what happened with Mibsam\n\n###Verse 14\nMishma = mišmāʿ = a hearing; Hitchcock’s: hearing, obeying<br>\nDumah = dûmâ = silence<br>\nMassa = maśśā' = burden; Hitchcock’s: a burden, prophecy<br>\n*More kids Dumah became the ancestor of a tribe in Arabia near the Persain Gulf, which makes it more east and a little more north compared to Arabia but more south compared to Assyria, near a rounded depression called Jauf (meaning Belly) the area contains a well and grows irrigated crops. Often visited by Europeans. During the time of Mohammed these people were Christians. This fact alone may be the answer to a question we asked before. Why would GOD preserve Ismael knowing that the Muslims would come from him and cause so many future problems. If the LORD had not preserved Ismael, then these Christians would not have existed ether. Massa has a questionable record in history he may be the father of a tribe in eastern Arabia near Babylon however the record is suspect and most biblical scholars say that Ismael’s son is not related to the record. Not any records on what happened with Mishma that I could find.\n\n###Verse 15\nHadar = ḥăḏaḏ = mighty, fierce; Hitchcock’s: power, greatness<br>\nTema = têmā' = desert; Hitchcock’s: admiration, perfection, consummation<br>\nJetur = yᵊṭûr = enclosed, encircled; Hitchcock’s: order, succession, mountainous<br>\nNaphish = nāp̄îš = refreshment, refreshed; Hitchcock’s: the soul, he that rests, refreshes himself, respires<br>\nKedemah = qēḏmâ = original, precedence; Hitchcock’s: oriental, ancient, first<br>\n*Even more kids from Ismael. It is interesting to note that Ismael had 12 sons just like Jacob later would. Hadad (Hadar) name is used a lot throughout the area but don’t know if this son is related to them or not. If so then he would have been part of the people that make up the Assyrian’s. Tema likely started a tribe in Assyria that corresponds to Teima today. 200 miles north of el-Medina and 40 miles south of Jauf (Dumah). These people area also associated with the Assyrians through ancient non-biblical records. Jetur made a tribe that warred with the two and a half tribes east of the Jordan and in the time of the New Testament they are called the Itureans. A group of people in the more north western part of Assyria. Naphish started a tribe that also lived in the area where the 2 and a half tribes are however these people were pretty much wiped out by Israel. They were closely connected with the Amorites the lines a blurry between Amorites and Assyrians.  Kedemah started the Kadmonite tribe meaning “the easterner” or “the ancient one”, these people became known for wisdom and were compared with Solomon. Also, in the Assyrian empire. This leads me to wonder about the 3 wise men I saw nothing official stating this but it makes me wonder if there is a connection. \n\n###Verse 16\nTowns = ḥāṣēr = a yard (enclosed by fence) a hamlet (surrounded by walls), enclosure, court\nSettlements = ṭîrâ = a wall, fortress, encampment, battlement<br>\nPrinces = nāśî' = exalted one, one lifted up (used for king or sheik) also rising mist<br>\nNations = 'ummâ = a collection, community of people, tribe, people<br>\n*It seems that all his children became leaders of the places they went\n\n###Verse 17\n*Ismael dies at 137. He was born when Abraham was 86 (Genesis 16:16) so he is 14 years older than Isaac. He would have been 89 when Abraham died. And at the time when Ishmael dies Isaac is 123 making Rebecca about 103ish\n\n###Verse 18\nHavilah = ḥăvîlâ = circle<br>\nShur = šûr = wall<br>\nAssyria = 'aššûr = a step<br>\n*It is interesting to me that the bible mentions these three places. The people in verse 13 ended up going to Arabia (Havilah), the people listed in verse 14 ended up in between and more west, still east of Israel but closer (Shur). And the people in verse 15 end up in Assyria\n\n###Verse 19\n*So now we have the family history so far leading up to Isaac\n\n###Verse 20\nSyrian = 'ărammy = exalted<br>\nPadan Aram = padān = field<br>\n*We see here that Isaac was 40 when he married Rebecca. Remember his mother died when he was 37. This means that the time for Abraham to plan and speak with his servant, and have that servant to go and retrieve Rebecca, took about approximately 3 years. Our range for the age of Rebecca compared to the age of Isaac was 17 to 20 years old. This “travel time” pushes Rebecca’s age closer to 20 at the time of her marriage to Isaac.\n\n###Verse 21\nPleaded = ʿāṯar = to burn incense in worship, intercede, pray, supplicate\nFor = nōḵaḥ = the front part, used adverbially: opposite, in front, forward, on behalf of<br>\nBarren = ʿāqār = sterile, barren\n*It seems that Abraham and Isaac have similar problems maybe it’s not such a good idea to marry close relatives even back then. But the important part here is that in his time of need he prays to the LORD. And the LORD fulfills his promise\n\n###Verse 22\nStruggled = rāṣaṣ = to crack in pieces, crush; used both literally or figuratively<br>\nInquired = dāraš = to tread or frequent, to flow, by implication: to seek or ask, also used for: to worship<br>\n*She is blessed with twins and in a foreshadowing of events to come they were struggling in the womb\n\n###Verse 23\nWomb = beṭen = to be hollow, the belly, especially the womb, can even mean body<br>\nPeople = lᵊ'ōm = to gather, a community, people<br>\n*The LORD explains the struggle and tells Rebecca that she will have 2 nations come from her twins and that they will struggle against each other. The LORD also lets her know that the second born will be the child that continues the promise of a nation to Abraham\n\n###Verse 24\nTwins = tᵊ'ômîm = a twin, used both literally and figuratively [root: to be double, or complete] <br>\n*The LORD’s promise comes true again\n\n###Verse 25\nRed = 'aḏmōnî = reddish, red or ruddy [root: “'āḏam” to be flush or turn rosy] <br>\nHairy = śēʿār = hair, gives the sense of being disheveled<br>\nGarment = 'adereṯ = something ample or large, wide dress, cloak, can also mean glory<br>\nEsau = ʿēśāv = hairy, feeling course or rough, Hitchcock: he that acts or finishes<br>\n*Here we have a name for Esau, the name not only describes him physically but also describes his actions as well. Esau is a man of action rather than a man that sits down and thinks things through\n\n###Verse 26\nTook hold = 'āḥaz = to sieze, grasp or take possession of<br>\nHeel = ʿāqēḇ = a heel, figuratively: the rear (of an army) <br>\nJacob = yaʿăqōḇ = Heel holder, supplanter, Hitchcock: that supplants, undermines the heel<br>\n*Jacob is known as the supplanter, which means one who takes the place of another. Look at the Hebrew words used here they have two meaning the first strait forward meaning Jacob grasped Esau’s heel. However, if we look at it figuratively it says: the supplanter took possession of the man of action’s weakened position.  We also notice that Isaac is 60 when his children are born which means that Rebecca is approximately 40. This would mean that Abraham is still alive at 160 years old when his grandchildren are born. This is an example of how the bible is written compared to how we commonly write stories in modern English. We are used to things being told in chronological order. However, the bible usually will finish talking about an idea then go back in time to talk about another aspect. Just above this section Abraham died and was buried so if your not careful in reading this section then you may think that Abraham never met his grandchildren\n\n###Verse 27\nHunter = ṣayiḏ = the chase, game, hunting<br>\nMild = tām = morally pious, gentle, dear, complete<br>\n*We see two very different people here. Reminds me of my own two boys\n\n###Verse 28\n*We have biblical proof that the way to a man’s heart is though his stomach. \n\n###Verse 29\nCooked = zûḏ = to seethe, to boil, figuratively: to be insolent, act proudly, presumptuously or rebelliously<br>\nStew = nāzîḏ = something boiled, soup, sodden thing, pottage<br>\nWeary = ʿāyēp̄ = languid, faint, weary<br>\n*Jacob has stew and his brother must have been very exhausted\n\n###Verse 30\nFeed me = lāʿaṭ = to swallow greedily, causatively: to feed (Only time this word appears in the bible) <br>\nRed = 'āḏōm = rosy, red<br>\nEdom = 'ĕḏōm = red, Hitchcock: red earthy, blood<br>\n*Couple of things here, counting the word in verse 25 we have come across 3 different words that mean red. Maybe they are different shades of red? Second, we learn from this that the Edomites are descendants of Esau some of there struggle is recorded in the book of Obadiah. Edom may have been a nick name given to Esau he was out in the sun all the time so he probably looked pretty red in general\n\n###Verse 31\nSell = māḵar = to sell, or to surrender<br>\nBirthright = bᵊḵôrâ = the firstling of man or beast, first born<br>\n*Jacob sensing an opportunity and likely with knowledge of the LORD’s prophecy given to Rebecca tells his brother that he will give Esau the soup. The price would be that Esau would need to make Jacob be the first born\n\n###Verse 32\n*This is the important verse in this section. Esau says well I am going to die so I it doesn’t matter if I am first born. This is important because the LORD said that a nation will come from both children. Yet here we see that Esau does not have faith in the LORD’s promise. Yet Jacob shows that he does have faith that the LORD will fulfill his promise to make the older serve the younger\n\n###Verse 33\n*The deed is done and Jacob is now considered the first-born child\n\n###Verse 34\nLentils = ʿāḏāš = a lentil<br>\nDespised = bāzâ = to disesteem, despise<br>\n*It seems that Esau becomes somewhat bitter about the situation\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '26': "###Verse 1\n*Abimelech (my father is king) could be a title or a name. Some think he is the son of the king Abimelech that interacted with Abraham in Genesis 20. In Genesis 20 Abraham would have been close to 100 years old. Here we know that Isaac is at least 60 but it seems to me that this would have been after Abrahams death because Isaac seems to be making the decisions at this time. If that is the case then Isaac is at least 75 so if it is the same Abimelech then he has been king for 75 or more years. Considering that Abraham and Isaac both live over 170 years old it would make sense that others in that time period would be able to have similar longevity. So a 75 or more year reign for one king at that time would not be out of the question. I personally am inclined to believe that this is the same king that Abraham spoke with in Genesis 20. Going forward I will discuss ideas with this in mind\n\n###Verse 2\nAppeared = rā'â = to see, used literally or figuratively<br>\n*The LORD appears before Isaac. I think this is a physical appearance just as when Abraham had a physical appearance of the LORD and brought him food in Genesis 18. The LORD tells Isaac to live in a part of the promised land and to not go to Egypt. It seems that is where people went at this time period during a famine\n\n###Verse 3\n*The LORD then gives to Isaac personally the same promise that was given to his father\n\n###Verse 4\n*Notice here again is the same words used with Abraham in Genesis 22:18 “In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed”. This again point out that the promise of the coming Messiah is for all not just for Israel\n\n###Verse 5\n*The blessing of the promised land and large family is coming to Abraham because of his faith\n\n###Verse 6\nGerar = gᵊrār = a lodging place, a rolling country<br>\n*This is a philistine city south of Gaza. So, it is near the border of Egypt\n\n###Verse 7\n*It seems that Isaac has the same plan as Abraham did. He tells people that Rebecca is his sister so that they won’t kill him because of her beauty. Maybe that practice was more common than we think at that time period\n\n###Verse 8\nShowing endearment = ṣāḥaq = laugh (in merriment or scorn) <br>\n*On a show called brain games they wanted to see how in sink the brains of couples were they found that the brains of couples moved in sink during the times when they laughed together. So, Abimelech must have seen some connection between Isaac and Rebecca when he was watching them laugh together. Also, this to me shows that Isaac’s fears were not unfounded obviously the king was watching Rebecca pretty intently to notice this\n\n###Verse 9\n*This is why I think that this Abimelech is the same person as the one in Genesis 20. It seems to me that Abimelech wants Rebecca but he is weary because he was tricked before by Isaac’s father. Abimelech wanted to see if he could trust what Isaac said or not. It turns out that Abimelech was right so he confronts Isaac with this fact. Note: some of this is my conjecture but this is what makes since to me\n\n###Verse 10\nGuilt = 'āšām = guilt, by implication: fault, also used for sin-offering<br>\n*Abimelech gets upset at Isaac’s deception, presumably because of what happened last time\n\n###Verse 11\n*Abimelech makes a decree to protect Isaac and Rebecca from the people. I see this as self-serving, last time in Genesis 20 the LORD made a plague occur among the people and Abimelech had to pay 1000 pieces of silver along with livestock and servants in order to atone for how he treated Abraham and Sarah. To me, it seems like Abimelech does not want to repeat that mistake\n\n###Verse 12\nSowed = zāraʿ = to sow, figuratively: to scatter seed or plant<br>\nHundred- = mē'â = Hundred<br>\nFold = šaʿar = measure (only place this word appears in the bible<br>\n*Looking at wheat according to mother earth news a farmer in Vermont was boasting about how he planted 30 pounds of wheat and was able to harvest 250 pounds of Grain from it. Heirloom wheat averages 44.6 Bushels per acre in Pennsylvania. Nation wide normal wheat average yield is 44.5 bushels per acer according to Statista.com. Looks like the national record holder is 206.7 bushels per acre by Derek Friehe in Moses Lake Washington. Several researchers in Organ and Nebraska have come to the conclusion that the ideal for wheat seeds is to have 18 seeds per row foot. More or less than that gives diminishing yields. Cropwatch.edu says that the best yielding seeds are large in size. In a field where there is a 6 inch row foot spacing one acre of seed here would require 157 pounds of this High quality seed. The lowest quality they have is the smallest seeds and 14 inch row spacing. This would require 37 pounds of seed per acre. From what I can see 10 inches seems to be the average in the US. Average weight of seed per acre for this would be 69.55 pounds of seed to plant per acre, with a range of 94 to 52. A bushel of wheat weighs about 60 pounds. So, 60 pounds times 44.5 bushels is 2670 pounds of wheat 2670/69.55 = 38.3-fold yield. I did see articles mentioning 5-inch rows and I suppose you could even go less if you are very specialized in it which may be the case for the record yield holder however if we assume 6-inch rows with the highest quality wheat the % yield for the 206.7 record holder would be just under 77-fold. If tighter rows were used that would just decrease the yield. All this to say that the LORD blessing Isaac with 100-fold is divine intervention\n\n###Verse 13\n*Isaac is greatly blessed by the LORD\n\n###Verse 14\nGreat Number = raḇ = abundant<br>\nOf Servants = ʿăḇudâ = something wrought, service<br>\nEnvied = qānā' = to be zealous, (in a bad sense) Jealous or envious, to be provoked to jealousy<br>\n*The part translated to great number of servants could be an abundance of services or abundance of things wrought (aka made). There is another word that is used for servant “ʿăḇudâ” is only found twice in the Bible\n\n###Verse 15\nStopped up = sāṯam = to stop up, shut up, figuratively: to keep secret, can also be used to mean repair<br>\n*It seems that another similarity is that the Philistines are still fighting over wells. Also seems like Abimelech forgot the covenant he made with Abraham in Genesis 21:31. It is not spelled out what the covenant is but based on the context of the section. It is fairly clear that Abimelech was supposed to leave Abraham’s wells alone. According to Verse 18 they filled these in after Abraham’s death so maybe in Abimelech’s mind the covenant is no longer valid\n\n###Verse 16\nMightier = ʿāṣam = to bind fast, to be powerful or numerous, be vast, be mighty, to crunch the bones, can also mean to close the eyes<br>\n*Abimelech seems worried here because his people are messing with the wells that belong to Isaac. And Isaac’s household is much stronger than the Philistines at this point\n\n###Verse 17\nPitched his tent = ḥānâ = to incline, or bend down, by implication: the decline of the slanting rays of evening, specifically: to pitch a tent, generally: to encamp<br>\nValley = naḥal = a stream, narrow valley, a shaft, torrent-valley<br>\nGerar = gᵊrār = a lodging place<br>\n*Isaac handles the philistine aggression a little differently. Rather than confronting Abimelech like Abraham did Isaac tries to live in peace and walks away\n\n###Verse 18\n*Here Isaac gives us a good example of forgiveness. Remember to sin is to incur a debt so now the one who sinned owes an unpayable debt to the LORD and another debt to whoever was wronged. In this case Abimelech owes Isaac some wells. Yet Isaac shows forgiveness by digging the wells himself. He pays for Abimelech’s debt\n\n###Verse 19\n*Isaac is able to find new wells of water. Yet another example of the LORD blessing Isaac\n\n###Verse 20\nQuarreled = rîḇ = to toss, to grapple, figuratively: to wrangle, to hold a controversy, strive, contend, by implication: to defend<br>\nEsek = ʿēśeq = contention, strife, (only place this word appears in the Bible) <br>\nStrove = ʿāśaq = to press upon, quarrel, strife (only place this word appears in the Bible also) <br>\n*3 different words here that all are mean strife, they just have different flavors. Notice here again there is Abimelech’s people taking Isaac’s well but this time it is a new well that Isaac dug for himself\n\n###Verse 21\nStinah = śiṭnâ = Strife, Hitchcock: Hatred (only place this word appears in the Bible) <br>\n*Yet another word for strife and it seems the Bible has little strife in it because 3 of the four only appear once. Isaac again responds with peace and forgiveness and moves on to dig a new well for himself, However the Philistines seem relentless in taking Isaac’s wells\n\n###Verse 22\nMoved = ʿāṯaq = removed, to grow old, to move, proceed, advance, specifically: to transcribe<br>\nRehoboth = rᵊḥōḇôṯ = wide places or streets, Hitchcock: spaces, places<br>\nMade room = rāḥaḇ = to broaden, to be or grow wide or large<br>\n*After continually moving on and avoiding conflict by taking the burden upon himself Isaac gets far enough away from the Philistines. Now they are no longer fighting over water. An apt verse for the description of Isaacs life is Matthew 5:9\n\n###Verse 23\nBeersheba = bᵊ'ēr šeḇaʿ = well of the sevenfold oath<br>\n*We have seen this well many times so far remember this is where Ismael was saved from death and where Abraham planted the salt cedar trees. It is on the way to Egypt relatively close to the border in the southwest of the promised land.\n\n###Verse 24\nSake = ʿăḇûr = crossed, abstractly: transit, adverbially: on account of, in order that<br>\n*This well seems to be a place where the LORD likes to appear. We have seen the word “ʿăḇûr” before it is used in Genesis 3:17 in the garden, and 8:21 after the flood. In Genesis 18:26-32 when the LORD says he will spare the city for X number of righteous, and here. It is interesting to me that this word literally means crossed. I think this brings out a few ideas first that the LORD is doing something for us. Second that the LORD is crossing the divide that separates us form him. And third he does it with a cross. Look at Isaac’s life. He turns the other cheek, pays the debt for others, he is a peacemaker. The recording of Isaacs life not only gives us an example of how we should live our own lives but also points us to Jesus. And verse 24 points to the idea that Jesus must come to us we cannot cross that divide ourselves no matter how “good” we are. Even Isaac needed the LORD to cross that divide and come to him.\n\n###Verse 25\nDug = kārâ = to dig, to plot, to bore open<br>\n*Isaac builds an alter to the LORD and finds yet another well\n\n###Verse 26\nAhuzzath = 'ăḥuzzaṯ = possession (only place this appears in the bible) <br>\nFriends = mērēaʿ = a friend or companion<br>\nPhichol = pîḵōl = strong, the mouth of all Hitchcock: every tongue<br>\n*Abimelech and a few friends come to meet with Isaac. Phichol accompanied Abimelech before when they met with Abraham in Genesis 21. In that place he was recorded as the commander of Abimelech’s army. This is just another source of evidence to support that these are indeed the same people that met with Abraham years ago\n\n###Verse 27\nWhy = madûaʿ = wherefore, what is known, why? <br>\n*Isaac seems to be upset that the Philistines are here again. He just built an alter and dug two wells\n\n###Verse 28\nIs = hāyâ = to exist, to become, to come to pass<br>\nLet us make = kāraṯ = to cut, by implication: to destroy or consume, specifically: to covenant (by cutting flesh and passing between the pieces) <br>\nCovenant = bᵊrîṯ = a compact (made by passing between pieces of flesh) <br>\n*They have come to make a deal with Isaac as they did before with Abraham\n\n###Verse 29\nHarm = raʿ = bad or evil<br>\nPeace = šālôm = safe, well, happy, friendly, welfare, health, prosperity, completeness, soundness, peace<br>\n*Seems as though ether Abimelech sees the relationship between himself and Isaac differently or more likely Abimelech is playing innocent. Looking back at 20 and 21 in Abimelech played innocent with Abraham several times. I believe that Abimelech is pretending to be innocent when in reality he knows exactly what is going on. Remember Abimelech said that Isaac’s people were more numerous than the Philistines. It seems clear to me that Abimelech is worried about retaliation from Isaac for how he was treated by the Philistines\n\n###Verse 30\n*Isaac the peacemaker accepts\n\n###Verse 31\n*They get up early in the morning to swear the oath\n\n###Verse 32\n*The servants have found yet another well\n\n###Verse 33\nShebah = šiḇʿâ = an oath, seven (only place this word appears in the Bible) <br>\nBeersheba = bᵊ'ēr šeḇaʿ = well of the seven-fold oath<br>\n*Beersheba is a compound word from “bᵊ'ēr” meaning well and “šiḇʿâ” meaning seven oath. It is possible that Isaac dug 7 wells. I count 6 times where wells are dug but the first says that Isaac uncovered the wells of his father Abraham. This implies that he uncovered more than one if it was two then Isaac would have dug 7 wells. May be why they have the seven in the word Shebah\n\n###Verse 34\nJudith = yᵊhûḏîṯ = praised, Jewess, Hitchcock: same as Judah<br>\nBeeri = bᵊ'ērî = my well<br>\nBasemath = bāśmaṯ = spice, fragrance<br>\nElon = 'êlôn = terebinth (tree), mighty, oak grove<br>\nHittite = ḥitî = descendant of Heth, Hitchcock: who is broken, who fears<br>\n*Judith must mean praised because Judah was not born yet and she came form the Hittites. Hittites are descended from Noah through Ham, Cannan and Heth. So, they are Canaanites. Esau and Jacob are 40 at this time so Isaac would be 100 and Rebecca would be 80\n\n###Verse 35\nGrief = mōrâ = bitterness, trouble (only place this word appears in the Bible) <br>\nOf mind = rûaḥ = wind, by resemblance: breath, figuratively: life, anger, by extension: spirit or region of the sky<br>\n*Isaac and Rebecca are not happy about Esau’s choice to marry Hittites\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible. English words taken from New King James Version\n",
      '27': "###Verse 1\nDim = kāhâ = to be weak, or faint figuratively: to despond, or grow dull<br>\n*Isaac is getting old and his eyes are failing. It is difficult to say here exactly how old Isaac is. However, we do know that while Isaac is old and feeble his death is not as close as everyone thinks it is. Remember Isaac dies at 180 years old which means that Jacob is 120 when Isaac dies. Jacob goes into Egypt at 130 years old when Joseph is 30. Which means that Isaac is 160 years old when Joseph is born. And the birth of Joseph happens at least over 21 years after Jacob flees to Laban’s house, but probably much longer than that because Joseph is the second youngest of the 12 sons. But so far, the oldest Isaac could be at this point is 138 (with one year of travel time) to Laban’s house in Haran. At this point if I had to guess I would say Isaac is approximately between 100 and 120 years old at this point. This would make Jacob 40 to 60 years old at this time\n\n###Verse 2\n*Whether or not Isaac will die soon doesn’t matter. He and those around him think he will die soon\n\n###Verse 3\nWeapons = kᵊlî = something prepared, any apparatus<br>\nQuiver = tᵊlî = a quiver [root: to suspend or hang] (only time this appears in the Bible) <br>\nHunt = ṣûḏ = to lie in wait, by implication: to catch an animal, figuratively: to victual (gather/prepare food for people, usually provisions for a journey) <br>\nGame = ṣêḏâ = food<br>\n*3rd word we have seen for Hunt\n\n###Verse 4\nSavory food = maṭʿām = a delicacy, tasty<br>\n*Isaac loves good food\n\n###Verse 5\n*Rebecca overhears the conversation\n\n###Verse 6-7\n*Relays it to Jacob\n\n###Verse 8\n*Rebecca has a plan\n\n###Verse 9\nKid = gᵊḏî = young male goat<br>\nOf the goats = ʿēz = female goat, (can also be used to mean goats hair) <br>\n*She says to get a young goat. Based on the two words above I think she is saying to take a young goat that is still with its mother\n\n###Verse 10\n*Remember in Genesis 25, the LORD told Rebecca that Esau will serve Jacob. However, Isaac seems to favor Esau. Rebecca is acting on a plan to help out the LORD\n\n###Verse 11\nHairy = śāʿîr = shaggy, a he-goat, buck<br>\nSmooth = ḥālāq = smooth<br>\n*They must be fraternal twins rather than identical twins\n\n###Verse 12\nFeel = māšaš = to feel, by implication: to grope<br>\nI shall seem = hāyâ = to exist, become, come to pass<br>\nTo him = ʿayin = an eye<br>\nDeceiver = tāʿaʿ = to cheat, mock by analogy: to maltreat<br>\nCurse = qᵊlālâ = vilification, curse<br>\nBlessing = bᵊrāḵâ = benediction, blessing, by implication, prosperity<br>\n*A more direct translation might be: feeling will create in his eye cheating. Jacob knows that this could backfire and tries to think of what could go wrong and he is concerned about it\n\n###Verse 13\n*Rebecca says she will take the risk he just has to do what she says\n\n###Verse 14\n*The plan seems to be working so far\n\n###Verse 15\nChoice = ḥemdâ = delight<br>\nClothes = beḡeḏ = a covering, clothing, also used for treachery or pillage<br>\nPut on = lāḇaš = wrap around, by implication: put on a garment literal or figuratively<br>\n*Based on the context here it is pretty clear that she takes clothing from Esau we will see later that this makes Jacob smell like Esau. But if we look at the phrase translated as “Rebecca took choice clothes” we could take that to mean “Rebecca took delight in treachery”\n\n###Verse 16\nSkins = ʿôr = skin, by implication: leather hide<br>\nSmooth part = ḥelqâ = smoothness, figuratively: flattery, portion of ground<br>\nNeck = ṣaûā'r = binding the back of the neck (carrying a burden) <br>\n*Rebecca covers Jacob with goat hair to disguise how Jacob feels. Notice that in verse 11 above one of the words used to describe Esau’s hairiness is “śāʿîr”. Which means he-goat, I think Rebecca is selecting a young goat for two reasons first for the tenderness and flavor of the meat and second for the feel of the hair. She trying to match how Esau feels.\n\n###Verse 17\n*Everything is ready to begin the plan\n\n###Verse 18\n*Jacob calls out to his father Isaac, and Isaac asks who is calling\n\n###Verse 19\n*Jacob says he is Esau and that he is bringing what Isaac asked for\n\n###Verse 20\n*Isaac is suspicious for two reasons the one of those is mentioned here. It seems very unlikely that Esau would have found and prepared the game this fast. The other is mentioned in verse 22\n\n###Verse 21\nFeel = mûš = to touch<br>\n*Isaac asks Jacob to come near so he can feel him\n\n###Verse 22\n*Here is the other clue that makes Isaac suspicious. His son sounds like Jacob. But Isaac reaches out and feels the hair like Esau\n\n###Verse 23\nRecognize = nāḵar = to scrutinize, can be used with ether recognition: to acknowledge, be acquainted with, care for, respect, revere, regard, recognize, or with suspicion: to disregard, ignore, be strange toward, reject, resign, dissimulate<br>\nBlessed = bāraḵ = to kneel, by implication: to bless God (as an act of adoration) or man (as a benefit), can also be used as a euphemism: to curse<br>\n*At first it seems a little weird that here it says Isaac blessed Jacob then the very next verse Isaac questions if it is really Esau. I think it would make more since if “bāraḵ” was translated literally. I think Isaac simply kneels down\n\n###Verse 24\n*Isaac seems to still be unsure\n\n###Verse 25\nWine = yayin = effervesce, fermented wine, by implication: intoxication<br>\n*Isaac asks his son to bring him the food that he asked for\n\n###Verse 26\nKiss = nāšaq = to kiss, can be used to mean touch, or equip with a weapon<br>\n*Isaac will try one more time to make sure it is Esau\n\n###Verse 27\nSmelled = rîaḥ = to blow, or breathe, to smell, by implication: to perceive<br>\nSmell = rêaḥ = odor, scent<br>\nClothing = beḡeḏ = a covering, treachery, pillage<br>\n*I think it is interesting that “beḡeḏ” is one of several words that can be used to mean clothing but that this particular word is used here and it also can mean treachery. So, let’s look at how Isaac was tricked. First was that Rebecca had the knowledge of the conversation between Isaac and Esau. That knowledge allowed Jacob to pretend that he was Esau. Next, they tried to fool as many of the senses that they could. Isaac’s eyes were failing so that was taken care of already. They placed hair from a young goat on Jacob so he would feel like Esau. I think this was one reason Rebecca chose a young goat an older goat would have hair that is too course and would not feel like Esau’s natural hair. Secondly they fooled Isaac using taste Rebecca knew she needed to prepare something that would taste like game caught through hunting. It turns out that in the Mediterranean area it is very popular to eat something called “roast kid” which is meat from a goat that is under 1 year of age. People that eat it say that it does not have a strong flavor that you get from eating an adult goat. They say the meat is much leaner and it reminds them of venison. This is exactly the taste that Rebecca is looking for. Last, they have Jacob wear Esau’s clothing because Esau would have been out in the field hunting. They want Jacob to smell like his brother. The only clue that Isaac had was the sound of Jacob’s voice. So, only one of the 5 senses showed the deception while the other four and the knowledge all said that it was Esau. This is why Isaac was fooled but it also shows how deception works in general if you used mostly truth then it makes it easier for someone to believe the lie. I think this is why the LORD specifically points out one way to tell if someone is a false prophet - look at Deuteronomy 18:20-22 (other ways are found in Deuteronomy 13:1-5, Matthew 7:15-16, 1 John 4:1-6)\n\n###Verse 28\nDew = ṭal = dew<br>\nGrain = dāḡān = increase, grain<br>\nWine = tîrôš = must, fresh grape juice, rarely: fermented wine<br>\n*In the first part of the blessing Isaac asks the Lord to bless his son with plenty\n\n###Verse 29\nNations = lᵊ'ōm = to gather, a community<br>\nBe = hāvâ = to breathe, to be, become<br>\nServe = ʿāḇaḏ = to work (in any sense), by implication: to serve, till or enslave<br>\nMaster = gᵊḇîr = lord, master<br>\n*The second part of the blessing is about how others will treat him. The wording here is very interesting. First is the word “lᵊ'ōm” translated to nations we have seen this once before in Genesis 25:23. And the next time this word shows up in the bible is in Psalms. There are other words like “gôy” found in Genesis 17:16, which are translated to nations. Why I find this word so significant is because the passage in Genesis 25:23 is the prophecy given to Rebecca by the LORD about how Esau will serve Jacob. To me this is the major failing of Isaac in his life. The fact that Isaac uses the same word here and it is only found in these two places makes me come to the conclusion that Isaac is trying to change what the LORD had said. The LORD said the older will serve the younger. And again, Isaac uses the same word for serve as well when he tries to say that his mother’s son will bow down to him. To me this is Isaac trying to go directly against the will of God with this blessing. We also see another word “gᵊḇîr” translated to master this word is only found twice in the bible once here and later in verse 37 of this chapter. What happens is what the LORD says will happen. I like this passage for another reason it helps to show the faithfulness of the LORD. For those that say prophecies only come true in the bible because the people knew about them and made them happen, this shows the contrary. Even when the one who is given the promise actively tries to change the prophecy it does not matter. What the LORD declares is what will happen\n###Verse 30\n*Seems that Isaac’s plan was completed just in time\n\n###Verse 31\nThat = ʿăḇûr = crossed, transit, adverbially: on account of, in order that<br>\n*To me the used of the Hebrew word “ʿăḇûr” here points to where Esau’s faith is placed. Esau rather than seeking the LORD to cross the divide for him, is asking his father Isaac to cross over to him. We can see here how his misplaced faith causes his downfall\n\n###Verse 32\n*At this point we can see the first hints that Isaac getting concerned that he may have just made a mistake\n\n###Verse 33\nTrembled = ḥārēḏ = to shudder with terror, to fear, to hasten<br>\nWhere = 'ēp̄ô = here, can also be used with regard to time: now or then<br>\n*Now the fear is in full bloom. We have one of the fear words here which means to shudder so Isaac is shaking and informs Esau that he has already blessed another\n\n###Verse 34\nCried = ṣāʿaq = to shriek, by implication: to proclaim<br>\nBitter = mar = bitter, bitterness<br>\nCry = ṣᵊʿāqâ = shriek, cry, outcry<br>\n*Naomi in the book of Ruth 1:20 says to call her Mara rather than Naomi the word for bitter is where she gets that name. We have two different words for cry that both mean to shriek. Maybe they have to do with the tense of the word?\n\n###Verse 35\nDeceit = mirmâ = fraud, deceit, treachery<br>\n*Blessing here is benediction again. They realize that it was Jacob that stole Esau’s blessing. At least from their perspective that is what is happening. I think it was rather the other way around I think Isaac was trying to steal the blessing the LORD ordained for Jacob and give it to Esau\n\n###Verse 36\nNamed = šēm = a mark or memorial of individuality, by implication: honor, authority, character\nSupplanted = ʿāqaḇ = to swell up, to swell out, to seize the heel, figuratively: to circumvent, to restrain, to assail insidiously<br>\nReserved = 'āṣal = to join (with the idea of joining a selective group) so: to separate, to select, refuse, contact, lay aside, reserve, withdraw, withhold<br>\n*We have been discussing whether or not the meaning of the names came before or after the people were named. This exchange seems to suggest that the person was named based on some quality that the parents saw in them as a child, grab the heel, but then that child seems to go on to fulfill the meaning of the name. It also seems by mentioning Naomi from to book of Ruth that if your name does not become fulfilled then the name is changed to match who the person is at that time. It also seems that some people have their name changed even if they do fully embody the meaning of their name in their younger years, like Jacob himself\n\n###Verse 37\nlord = gᵊḇîr = lord, master<br>\nSustained = gᵊḇîr = to prop (literal or figurative), to lean upon, take hold of, lay, rest, support<br>\n*We have the second of the only two times “gᵊḇîr” appears in the bible. Esau asks to be blessed as well. However, Isaac points out that he was very thorough in the blessing that Esau would serve Jacob\n\n###Verse 38\n*Esau begins to despair and asks Isaac to give him a different blessing\n\n###Verse 39\nDwelling = môšāḇ = seat, figuratively: a site, dwelling-place, abstractly: a session, an assembly, by extension: an abode, dwelling, by implication: population, dwellers<br>\n*Isaac says that Esau will live in a place of plenty\n\n###Verse 40\nSword = ḥereḇ = drought, also used to mean a destructive cutting instrument like a knife or sword<br>\nRestless = rûḏ = to tramp about, ramble, wander restlessly, roam<br>\nBreak = pāraq = to break off, tear apart, tear away, crunch, figuratively: to deliver<br>\nYoke = ʿōl = a yoke, literal or figurative<br>\n*So, let’s compare the two blessings. The for Jacob it says that God will give him the plenty of the land and the service of the his brother and others. Knowing that Esau will be the servant of Jacob, Isaac’s blessing for him says that he will live in a land flowing with plenty and will serve his brother there. This basically just confirms that Esau will live with and serve Jacob. However, Isaac adds to the end of the blessing for Esau. He says that at some point Esau will break free of being a servant to his brother. An interesting thing to note about the descendants of Esau aka the Edomites and the descendants of Jacob aka the Israelites. If we look at 2 Samuel 8:14 we see that King David (Israelite) took control of Edom and the Edomites became his servants. This is a direct fulfillment of the blessing given to Jacob and Esau. But just as the second part of Esau’s blessing says, the Edomites become restless and revolt against King Jehoram. This is recorded in 2 Kings:20-22. \n\n###Verse 41\nHated = śāṭam = to lurk for, persecute, to bear a grudge, to cherish animosity, against<br>\nMourning = 'ēḇel = lamentation<br>\n*Esau is extremely upset, the word used for hated seems related to the root word for Satan. “śāṭam” is Strongs H7852 while Strongs H7853 “śāṭan” first used in Psalm 38:20 means the accuser, to attack, or be an adversary is the actual root word for Satan. But I think the name could come from both words. Anyway, Esau now plans to kill his brother after his father dies. Interesting note in history, Esau’s descendent tries to kill Jacobs most important descendant. In 47 BC Julius Caesar appointed Antipater the Edomite to be king over Judea. Remember Edomites are descendants of Esau.  Antipater’s son was king Herod during the time of Jesus\n\n###Verse 42\n*Again, Rebecca is listening and hears this as well. She warns Jacob so that he can flee\n\n###Verse 43\n*Rebecca sends Jacob off to her brother Laban. This is in Haran which just means a mountainous area. But we know this is near the Babylon area\n\n###Verse 44\nTarry = yāšaḇ = to sit, by implication to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry<br>\nFew = 'eḥāḏ = one, first<br>\nFury = ḥēmâ = heat, figuratively: anger, poison, rage<br>\n*The word “'eḥāḏ” means one. However, in context it can be used for meaning “each and every” or “a certain”. So, even though Rebecca literally said “sit with my brother for one day, until Esau’s heat turns back”. She could have meant “Live with my brother each and every day until Esau’s anger subsides”. \n\n###Verse 45\nForgets = šāḵaḥ = to mislay, to be oblivious of, used for memory or attention, forget<br>\nBereaved = šāḵōl = to miscarry, suffer abortion, by analogy: to bereave<br>\n*Rebecca knows that in time the sting will fade and Esau’s anger will fade. I think this is true about many things in our own lives. When a wrong done to us is fresh sometimes it is easy for us to do something we regret in retaliation. Over time however, we can see in perspective that what so angered us before was not so bad as we thought it was at the time. I think this is why the LORD says not to take vengeance. Look at Romans 12:19 which is quoting from Deuteronomy 32:35\n\n###Verse 46\nWeary = qûṣ = to be disgusted, to be anxious, to feel loathing, abhorrence or sickening dread<br>\n*Again, just as the LORD said to Abraham and Abraham said of Isaac, Isaac and Rebecca know that Jacob should not marry from among the local people. This is a second reason for them to send Jacob away to his ancestral house in Haran\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '28': "###Verse 1\n*Isaac tells Jacob not to marry a Canaanite. Isaac seems to have realized that it is the LORD’s will that Jacob be blessed. He does not seem to hold a grudge about being tricked by Jacob\n\n###Verse 2\n*Isaac sends Jacob to Rebecca’s father and brother and says to take a wife from Laban’s daughters. These would be his cousins.\n\n###Verse 3-4\nGod = 'ēl = strength, mighty, used to refer to God as well<br>\nAlmighty = šaday = the Almighty<br>\nAssembly = qāhēl = assemblage, convocation or congregation<br>\nGod = 'ĕlōhîm = gods in the ordinary sense, this is a plural word, sometimes used for magistrates or as a superlative, also used for the supreme God<br>\n*This is where El-Shaddai comes from also this blessing seems to fit more closely with the promise that the LORD has given to Abraham and Isaac. Example Genesis 17:6-8. It seems that Isaac has accepted that Jacob is the son that the promise if the LORD will go through\n\n###Verse 5\n*This passage reminds me of Romans 8:28. It doesn’t matter if Isaac is trying to go against the LORD in blessing Esau. It doesn’t matter if Jacob and Rebecca lie. It doesn’t matter if Esau is planning to kill his brother. The LORD works all things together for the good of those who love him. The LORD works everything together for the good of those that are called to His purpose. The LORD can take all of these negative things and work them together for good. He will do the same in our own lives if we love the LORD and try to follow His purpose\n\n###Verse 6\n*Esau on the other hand sees that Isaac and Rebecca do not want their children to marry Canaanites (of which Esau married 2 already)\n\n###Verse 7\n*Jacob does as his parents say\n\n###Verse 8-9\nDid not please = raʿ = bad, evil<br>\nMahalath = maḥălaṯ = stringed instrument, sickness<br>\nNebajoth = nᵊḇāyôṯ = heights, fruitfulness<br>\n*Esau tries to fix this by marring again. This time he marries one of the descendants of Ishmael. \n\n###Verse 10\n*Jacob heads out\n\n###Verse 11\nAt his head = mᵊra'ăšôṯ = a headpiece, the head-rest, place at the head, head-place<br>\n*On the way of following the will of the LORD Jacob finds a place to rest for the night with some very comfortable pillows…\n\n###Verse 12\nDreamed = ḥālam = to bind firmly, to be or make plump, be healthy or strong, figuratively: to dream<br>\nLadder = sullām = a stair-case (Only time this word is in the Bible) <br>\nIt’s top = rō'š = to shake the head, (used in many applications both literal and figurative) <br>\nReached = nāḡaʿ = to touch, (for any purpose, wide variety of uses) <br>\n*Jacob has a dream; he sees a staircase where the top of the staircase touches heaven\n\n###Verse 13\n*The LORD himself now appears standing above the ladder. \n\n###Verse 14\nSpread = pāraṣ = to break out, break though (used literal or figurative) <br>\nWest = yām = to roar, sound of a large body of water, the Mediterranean Sea, locally: the west<br>\nEast = qeḏem = the front, of a place or even of a time (ancient or before), adverbially: the east<br>\nNorth = ṣāp̄ôn = hidden, dark, gloomy, unknown, north<br>\nSouth = neḡeḇ = to be parched, Negeb, south<br>\n*The LORD confirms the promise will pass to Jacob and the LORD passes the promise on to Jacob. This is like the promise He gave to Abraham back in Genesis 13:14-17. Couple of important points first is the phrase that was also used with Abraham and Isaac “in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed”. We have mentioned this before but it is so important to the gospel message that we will discuss it again here. Jesus, while he will come though the seed of Jacob, will come to bless everyone on earth. The LORD’s promise is universal to all. Second the message stays the same the LORD does not change or tweak his promise based on events. The unchanging promise of the LORD allows us to trust in his promise that what He says will come to pass. -Another thing to note about this verse of lesser importance is that many Hebrew words have several very different meanings at least when translated to English, so it is important to pay attention to context\n\n###Verse 15\n*The LORD is with Jacob\n\n###Verse 16\nAwoke = yāqaṣ = to awake<br>\nSleep = šēnā' = to sleep<br>\nSurely = 'āḵēn = firmly, figuratively: surely, aversively: but<br>\n*This is a different word for sleep than we have seen before. Jacob knows the LORD is with him\n\n###Verse 17\nAfraid = yārē' = to fear, morally revere, causatively: to frighten<br>\nAwsome = yārē' = to fear, morally revere, causatively: to frighten<br>\n*We see here that the same word is used twice in the Hebrew. “yārē'” is translated as both afraid and awesome in the same verse. This word is related to yara which means a rolling of the gut (aka. Butterflies in the stomach). Jacob is experiencing this “yārē'”, which seems to be about reverence or awe about the place where GOD dwells\n\n###Verse 18\nPillar = maṣṣēḇâ = something stationed, a column or pillar, by analogy: an idol<br>\nPoured = yāṣaq = to pour out, to flow, by implication: to melt or cast metal, by extension: to place firmly, to stiffen or grow hard<br>\nOil = šemen = grease, especially liquid oil from the olive, figuratively: richness<br>\n*Jacob is setting up a marker for the LORD here\n\n###Verse 19\nBethel = bêṯ-'ēl = house of God (compound word) <br>\nBut = 'ûlām = however, on the contrary<br>\nLuz = lûz = almond tree<br>\n*Jacob also changes the name of the place from Almond Tree to House of God. Where is this place most scholars place it in Beitin north of Jerusalem, but there is no biblical evidence for that and writings of ancient pilgrims visiting the area clam a different area called El-Bireh is the location of Bethel. El-Bireh is still north of Jerusalem but a few miles closer to Jerusalem. The thing is I looked at a map of the area and found that there are not a lot of Almond trees in the area of Beitin or El-Bireh. There are however a lot of trees in Jerusalem. Bethel is also mentioned previously in Genesis 12:8 and 13:3 when Abraham passed through the area. In reading about areas chosen for Bethel and Ai I find them very suspect. For example, the sight that most scholars place Ai is Et-Tell. Then they dig up the area and say that they find no evidence of battle or occupation at the time of Joshua. Yet the Bible says in Joshua 7 and 8 that the Israelites concurred and occupied Ai. The scholars go on to say see the Bible is not always accurate. But the evidence that these locations are correct is very thin. I come from the mindset of starting with the Bible as true. So, if no archeological evidence is found for the occupation of the Et-Tell by Joshua, then that means Et-Tell is not the location of Ai. All the locations for Bethel and Ai are a little north of Jerusalem they are arguing over a few miles of difference but ether way this area seems to be very close to Jerusalem. At this point I tend to think that Bethel could be the sight of the Temple mount. From what I can find there was the potential that lots of Almond trees grew in that area and that is the place where the House of God will be built. As we continue going through the Bible, I will watch for anything biblical that ether supports or refutes this idea\n\n###Verse 20-21\nMade = nāḏar = to promise, vow<br>\nVow = neḏer = a promise, vow<br>\nWay= dereḵ = a road, figuratively: a course of life or mode of action<br>\n*Jacob asks the LORD to be with him and protect him and says if the LORD will take care of him then He will be the God of Jacob\n\n###Verse 22\nA tenth = ʿāśar = to accumulate, to tithe, to take or give a tenth<br>\n*Jacob promises to give a Tenth of all that the LORD gives to him. This spot may very will be the future sight of the temple mount… maybe\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

It seems to me that Jacob is almost immediately attracted to Rachel and wants to help her out by opening the well for her early\n\n###Verse 8\n*To me the other shepherds are saying it’s not time yet we will wait until all the flocks are gathered together. But some believe this means that the shepherds are physically unable to open the well until they get enough people to move it\n\n###Verse 9\n*Rachel shows up with the sheep early, but the well is closed\n\n###Verse 10\n*Jacob wanting to help Rachel out goes and opens the stone for her himself. If the stone is so heavy that multiple shepherds are needed to open the stone then Jacob must be very strong and showing off a little to Rachel. However, it could be that Jacob was just opening it early and it was heavy enough that Rachel may not be able to open it herself but still openable by a single person. \n\n###Verse 11\nWept = bāḵâ = to weep, to bemoan (can be used for grief, humiliation or joy) <br>\n*It seems that Jacob is so full of emotion that he cannot contain it\n\n###Verse 12\n*Jacob reveals that he is family and Rachel goes to tell her father\n\n###Verse 13\nReport = šēmaʿ = something heard, a sound, rumor, announcement, abstractly: audience<br>\nEmbraced = ḥāḇaq = to clasp, embrace<br>\n*Jacob fills in Laban on the events\n\n###Verse 14\n*Jacob stays with Laban for a month\n\n###Verse 15\nNothing = ḥinnām = gratis, devoid of cost, reason or advantage<br>\nWages = maśkōreṯ = wages, reward<br>\n*Apparently Jacob has been working for Laban while staying with him so Laban asks Jacob what he wants for his labor\n\n###Verse 16\nLeah = lē'â = Weary, Hitchcock: Weary, Tired<br>\nRachel = rāḥēl = to journey, ewe, Hitchcock: sheep<br>\n*The two daughters of Laban\n\n###Verse 17\nDelicate = raḵ = tender, delicate, soft, by implication: weak<br>\nForm = tō'ar = outline, figure, appearance, form<br>\n*Now we see why Jacob fell in love with Rachel at first sight\n\n###Verse 18\n*Jacob says he will serve Laban for seven years for Rachel \n\n###Verse 19\n*Laban agrees, but we have seen in the past that what Laban says is not always what he will do\n\n###Verse 20\n*Jacob works for the agreed upon seven years and this feels short to him\n\n###Verse 21\n*Jacob asks Laban to hold up his end of the deal\n\n###Verse 22\n*Laban puts together a big feast for them\n\n###Verse 23\n*Laban then switched his daughters and tricked Jacob.

Many scholars say that Jacob only had to wait one week for a marital period for Leah then after the week he was able to marry Rachel and that Jacob did not have to wait seven more years to marry Rachel. Most of the sources that I found that claim Jacob only had to wait a week base their reasoning on this verse alone. I did find one source about Ancient Jewish Wedding customs. According to Jamie Lash (https://www.jewishjewels.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ancient_Jewish_Wedding.pdf) first there is a betrothal then the Groom would build a wedding structure. Then they would marry by the bride being carried to the groom the guests would celebrate and walk at the end of the celebration the guests would walk the couple to the bridal chamber and then the couple would stay in there for the next seven days. Now this custom may have been around at the time of Jacob or it could have been a custom that was developed later. When looking at the word “šāḇûaʿ” translated to week you can see that it merely means a period of seven so it could mean seven days or seven years. In fact, later it points out that the word is often understood to mean years.  Did Jacob have to work for 7 years again and then marry Rachel? Why would Laban (the one who is always trying to delay things and keep hard workers as long as possible) give Rachel to Jacob after only a week then hope that Jacob will stick around for the next 7 years? In many ways it makes more since that Jacob was Married to Leah for 7 years then married Rachel. It’s hard to know the age of Jacob at this time but counting backward he should be approximately 82 when he married Leah and ether 82 or 89 when he married Rachel. If Jacob had seven years with Leah before he married Rachel that could help explain why Leah had more children than Rachel. However, I don’t think there is any way to know for sure from this verse if Jacob waited a week or another seven years for Rachel, however on verse 30 I think it becomes more clear\n\n###Verse 29\nBilhah = bilhâ = troubled, timid, Hitchcock: who is old or confused<br>\n*Rachel gets a servant as well\n\n###Verse 30\nAlso = gam = to gather, assemblage, also, even, yea, though<br>\nStill = ʿôḏ = continuance, again, repeatedly, still more<br>\nAnother = 'aḥēr = hinder, next, other, another<br>\n*The Hebrew words here are “bô' gam 'ēl rāḥēl 'āhaḇ gam rāḥēl lē'â ʿāḇaḏ ʿim ʿôḏ šeḇaʿ šānâ 'aḥēr”. Couple of things here. I don’t see anything in this passage that clearly says that Rachel is loved more than Leah. We can see however, that Rachel is listed before Leah (who was older and married first). In the Hebrew there is no punctuation we added that for English and I think this is one of those times where the English punctuation may me making this verse more confusing. To me, this verse contains 2 main ideas. First, Jacob also when into and loved Rachel. Second, Together Rachel and Leah served with Jacob for another seven years. And I think this is where the passage is more clear. We have much more support for the idea that Jacob married Rachel after only a week then they all stayed to work for Laban for the next seven years.\n\n###Verse 31\nUnloved = śānē' = hate<br>\n*Leah is unloved “śānē'” mean hate and is usually used for an enemy. This reminds me of what Jesus says in Matthew 6:24. Basically when serving 2 masters you will hate one and love the other. We can also see from this verse that Leah and Rachel seem to be living with Jacob at the same time. And have a reason for why Leah has children while Rachel does not\n\n###Verse 32\nReuben = rᵊ'ûḇēn = behold a son, Hitchcock: who sees the son, the vision of the son<br>\n*We can see that the LORD has blessed Leah and even though Jacob did not want or love her, the LORD has put her in the position of prominence. He has Leah have the first born and He has made one of Leah’s children lead to Jesus. It seems that the LORD is trying to show us a few things with the story of Leah. One that the LORD seems to have chosen and honored her as the true wife of Jacob. Also, I think that Leah’s struggle and heartache can show us a glimpse of what the LORD must feel when His children and His chosen people turn away from Him.\n\n###Verse 33\nSimeon = šimʿôn = heard, hearing, Hitchcock: that hears or obeys, that is heard<br>\n*Leah has a second child\n\n###Verse 34\nAttached = lāvâ = to twine, unite, to remain, to borrow, to lend<br>\nLevi = lēvî = joined to, attached, Hitchcock: associated with him<br>\n*The third child, Leah seems ever more hopeful with each child that this will make her husband love her\n\n###Verse 35\nPraise = yāḏâ = to use, to hold out the hand, physically: to throw or cast something (at or away), to revere or worship (with extended hands), intensively: to bemoan (by wringing the hands) <br>\nJudah = yᵊhûḏâ = praised, celebrated, Hitchcock: the praise of the LORD, confession<br>\n*With Judah Leah it seems finally has decided to take Joy in what she has rather than focusing on what she does not have. Rather than wishing that with this 4th child now my husband will love me. She now just praise’s the LORD for giving her the four children. And it is this child of praise that the LORD choses to use to continue the line of promise to Jesus. From what I can tell these children are born during the second seven years of working with Laban. Jacob should be approximately mid to late 80’s at this time\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

Dan, I have always been curious about Dan. If you look at Revelation 7:4-8 Dan is missing instead we have Manasseh, who was a child of Joseph. I have always wondered why Dan is missing and the bible never really directly says. There are several theories. Some say that Dan was wiped out and the line no longer exists. Some say they have become part of the Phoenicians. Some say that because of there severe idolatry that they have been cut out of the promise and will not be part of the final kingdom and even that the antichrist may come from the tribe of Dan. Some say that they have been cut out for now but may be brought back in during the tribulation. I wonder if the missing tribe of Dan has to do with he being the first born from someone that is not Jacob’s wife. Nobody really knows for sure but it is interesting to speculate on this\n\n###Verse 7\n*Apparently Rachel planned for this to be more than a one-time thing.

And she names Naphtali to represent this. His name seems to come from a combination of two words that both mean to struggle\n\n###Verse 9\n*Now let’s look at this from the perspective of each of the two women. Rachel needs a son to secure her future her husband is in his mid to late 80’s and if Rachel does not have a son then she could become destitute. This would justify one child but once the second one is born, Leah starts to take notice. The more children that are born under Rachel’s name mean that she will take a larger and larger portion of the inheritance. Leah who seems to no longer be having children gives her maid to Jacob to get in on the race.\n\n###Verse 10\n*Leah’s maid has a child now, Jacob’s 7th son\n\n###Verse 11\nA troop comes = gāḏ = fortune (only time this appears in the Bible)\nGad = gāḏ = troop, Hitchcock: band, troop\n*Interesting that they seem to focus on the troop while the word Gad is probably more closely translated to fortune. Having a troop of children will lead to a fortune but to me fortune seems like a more accurate meaning for the name especially when that is the only motive that I can think of that would make Leah want Jacob to have children with her maid. We can even look to another name in the bible Baal-Gad which means idol of fortune. \n\n###Verse 12\n*More children are coming, #2 for Zilpah, #8 for Jacob\n\n###Verse 13\nHappy = 'šer = happiness (only time this appears in the Bible)\nBlessed = 'āšar = to be strait (used in a very wide sense, to be level, to be right, to be happy) figuratively: to go forward, to be honest, prosper, advance\nAsher = 'āšēr = happy, happiness\n*Asher also seems to be a combination of two words the first means happy the second means to be strait but carries the idea of being happy or prospering\n\n###Verse 14\nWheat = ḥiṭṭâ = wheat\nHarvest = qāṣîr = severed, i.e. harvest, the crop, the time, the reaper, figuratively: a limb\nMandrakes = dûḏay = a boiler or basket, mandrake\n*Reuben finds some mandrakes and brings them to his mother and Rachel asks if she can have some. The mandrake is a plant that grows in the area that is part of the nightshade family. They are poisonous they have both atropine and belladonna poisons in them. This leads to headache, pupil dilation, dry mouth, vomiting, increased circulation, rapid heart rate, hyperactivity and Hallucinations. People at the time believed that mandrakes would help them be more fertile which is likely why Rachel wants to have some.\n\n###Verse 15\n*Leah trades the mandrakes for the ability to spend the night with her husband\n\n###Verse 16\nHired = śāḵar = temporary purchase, to hire\n*Jacob came home to find out that his wives have made a deal\n\n###Verse 17\n*This results in a 5th son for Leah, #9 for Jacob\n\n###Verse 18\nIssachar = yiśśāśḵār = there is recompense, he will bring a reward, Hitchcock: reward, recompense [two roots: to lift or carry and payment of contract, salary, wages]\n\n###Verse 19\n*Leah again makes #6 for her and #10 for Jacob\n\n###Verse 20\nEndowed = zāḇaḏ = to confir, bestow upon, endow with (only time this appears in the Bible)\nEndowment = zeḇeḏ = a gift, endowment (only time this is in the Bible also)\nDwell = zāḇal = to enclose, exalt, honor, i.e. to reside (only time this appears in the Bible)\nZebulun = zᵊḇûlûn = exalted, habitation, Hitchcock: dwelling, habitation\n*It is clear that the name is based on a word that means dwelling however we have seen 5 or 6 words that can also be translated to dwelling so far so I think the other connotation of exaltation or honor is the more emphasized meaning of the name here. I think this holds true for the line where Leah says that now Jacob will dwell with me. She could be saying now Jacob will honor or exalt me.\n\n###Verse 21\nDinah = dînâ = judgement, justice, Hitchcock: judgement, who judges\nJacob and Leah’s first daughter, Leah’s 7th child, and Jacob’s 11th\n\n###Verse 22\n*Rachel is not forgotten\n\n###Verse 23\nReproach = ḥerpâ = contumely, disgrace, reproach, the pudenda, \n*Apparently, this whole time Rachel is feeling like her family is being rude to her or she is disgraceful or shameful\n\n###Verse 24\nJoseph = yôsēp̄ = Jehovah has added, let him add, Hitchcock: increase, addition\n*Rachel has a son of her own but added to the two her maid had this would be an addition to Rachel. #1 for Rachel, 11th son for Jacob, (12th child that we know of)\n\n###Verse 25\n*It seems that these 12 children were born during the 7 years while Jacob worked for Laban to pay for Rachel and she finally has a child right at the end of that 7-year period. Let’s do a quick age count here Joseph is born, Jacob is somewhere between 87 and 93 I’m based on ages and times given plus some estimation using Genesis 41 through 47. So, for easy math I will say Jacob is approximately 90 when Joseph is born this would make Isaac about 150 (he still has 30 years to live at this point) Rebecca would be about 130ish, that would make Laban around that age as well. We have no idea how old Leah and Rachel are although they are young enough to have children. Leah could be anywhere from 20 to 70 in my opinion with Rachel being maybe 5 to 10 years younger but on this point, I am just guessing. Reuben is probably about 6 and a half years older than Joseph. Next, we will look at how Jacob was able to have 7 children in that order within 7 years. I came up with a calculation that seems realistic to me especially when you consider that these women are racing and struggling against each other to see who can have the most children. To preface this, I looked it up and it is more common than you would think for women to have children 9 months apart. I even came across a story of a nurse being impressed because according to her calculations the patient must have gotten pregnant the day she left the hospital from her previous birth. Another key to this is the line in Genesis 29:35 when it says that Leah stopped bearing. I take this to mean that Leah had a cycle and that is how she knew she was not pregnant again which means she would have had no cycles during the first four previous births. So that means that Reuben born 9 months after the marriage, then Simeon born 9-10 months later, then Levi 9-10 months, then Judah 9-10 months. This puts us at 3 years to 3 years and 3 months. Then add one month for Leah to have a cycle then Dan. Now the only way Dan fits is if Rachel gave her maid (Bilhah) to Jacob before Judah was born this means that 2 to 3 months after Judah, Dan is born. (Now we are at 3 years 3 months to 3 years 5 months) And 9 to 10 months later Naphtali is born. Same for Leah’s maid (Zilpah) Gad had to be born 1 to 3 months after Naphtali. (1 month if the other kids are closer to 10 months apart and 3 months if the others are closer to 9 months apart). This puts us at 4 years 3 months to 4 years 4 months. Next, we have Asher 9 to 10 months later. Reuben must have found the mandrakes while Zilpah was early in her pregnancy so that Leah could then have Issachar 1 to 3 months later, then Zebulun 9 to 10 months after that. And finally, Dinah 9 to 10 months. This puts us at 6 years 9 months to 6 years 11 months.  And God remembered Rachel, who must have conceived after all the other brothers were born, during the time of Dinah’s gestation, so that Joseph can be born 1 to 3 months later putting him right at 7 years. But wait there’s more. I came across an article from the biblical archaeology society (https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/people-in-the-bible/rachel-and-leah-in-the-bible/) which says that in that time normally the bride price must be paid before the marriage however, exceptions were made. For the exceptions the rule was that the bride price had to be paid before the birth of the first child. I find it interesting that Rachels first child is born at seven years exactly when the bride price was paid\n\n###Verse 26\n*Jacob has been here 14 years hand has 12 children and comes to Laban to say his time is completed and he is ready to go back home\n\n###Verse 27\nLearned by Experience = nāḥaš = to hiss, whisper a spell, practice divination, to prognosticate\n*Laban wants to have Jacob stay because he knows that the LORD is blessing Jacob. \n\n###Verse 28\nName = nāqaḇ = to puncture, pierce, figuratively: to specify, designate or label\n*Laban asks what it will take for Jacob to stay on with him\n\n###Verse 29\n*Jacob points out that he is indeed good with livestock\n\n###Verse 30\nWhen = māṯay = to extend, extent of time, adverbially: when\n*We can see here why Laban does not want Jacob to leave. But, Jacob asks when will I be able to provide for my own house\n\n###Verse 31\n*Laban asks what Jacob wants. It is worth noting in this verse that Jacob says Laban will not give Jacob anything\n\n###Verse 32\nSpeckeled = nāqōḏ = to mark (by puncturing or branding), spotted, speckled\nSpotted = ṭālā' = to cover with pieces, to spot or variegate, patch\nSheep = śê = pushing out to graze, member of the flock\nBrown = ḥûm = to be warm, sunbrunt or swarthy (Dark colored), darkened, dark brown or black\nLambs = keśeḇ = a young sheep, lamb\n*Jacob asks to pass though the flock and collect the imperfect sheep for himself as his wages. I find it interesting that he is leaving the pure white ones for Laban because the Hebrew word for white is Laban. Another note about this verse is that Jacob says “and these shall be my wages” this whole phrase is translated from just 2 Hebrew words “hāyâ” and “śāḵār”. “hāyâ” means to exist and this is the word that is used when the LORD creates something. While “śāḵār” means to pay a contract. So, this is saying something more like let me remove the impure animals and create the payement\n\n###Verse 33\nIn time = yôm = to be hot, a day\nTo come = māḥār = deferred, the morrow, tomorrow, indefinitely: hereafter\nStolen = gānaḇ = to thieve, steal, by implication: to deceive\n*Jacob continues and says that if tomorrow he is found with any non-spotted sheep, then he will be stealing\n\n###Verse 34\n*Laban agrees\n\n###Verse 35\nSo he removed = sûr = to turn off, turn aside\nMale Goats = tayiš = to butt, a buck or male goat, he-goat\nSpeckeled = ʿāqōḏ = striped (with bands), streaked\nOf his sons = bēn = a son, in the widest sense, grandson, (could be literal son or figurative son)\n*Someone takes away all the impure animals that day and gives them to the sons of Laban and takes them 3 days away. This leaves behind all the pure white sheep. Who is the person that did that. Reading of the NKJV translation, he removed the impure sheep and gave them to his sons, seems to be saying that Laban removed the sheep but when we look at the Hebrew it just says turn aside the impure sheep to the hand of sons. Many time in the past when reading this section I always thought that Laban is up to his old tricks again and that he took these sheep in order to cheat Jacob. But when I look closer, I think this is saying something completely different. It looks to me like Jacob went through that day, as he said he would, and took all the impure sheep out then sent them off to be separated from the flock of pure sheep. Then if the next day Jacob was found with any non-pure white sheep then those will be considered stolen. Jacob then plans to create his payment from this pure white flock over the next 6 years\n\n###Verse 36\nThe rest = yāṯar = to jut over or exceed, by implication: to excel, to remain or be left, causatively: to leave, cause to abound, preserve\n*Laban’s sons took his impure sheep 3 days away and Jacob was given all the pure sheep to take care of\n\n###Verse 37\nRods = maqqēl = to germinate, a shoot, a stick, rod or staff\nGreen = laḥ = to be new, fresh, moist, unused\nPoplar = liḇnê = some sort of whiteish tree, perhaps the storax (only used 2x in the bible here and Hosea 4:3)\nAlmond = lûz = some kind of nut tree, perhaps the almond tree\nChestnut = ʿarmôn = the plane tree\nPeeled = pāṣal = to peel (only used twice in the bible in this verse and verse 38)\nStrips = pᵊṣlôṯ = a peeling, peeled spot or stripe (only time this appears in the bible)\nExposed = maḥśp̄ = a peeling, laying bare (only time this is in the bible)\n*The general consensus is that poplar is the storax also known as snowbell. This plant is a plant that was used in ancient times to make a type of frankincense called “Javan Frankincense”. Storax is mostly used as a perfume or air freshener at that time. It can produce toxic substances like benzene and formaldehyde when burned. Jacob did not burn these so there would not be any of these substances to worry about. So, what is the reason for using these plants? It turns out there are several studies done which show that sheep ingesting the poplar plant have increased conception and birth rates. They are also more likely to have multiple young in a birth. Almond tree bark is used to increase milk production and reduce birth pangs. Almond also has many beneficial effects for the reproductive and urinary systems as well as treating diseases in those same systems. The plane tree (often translated chestnut tree most say is actually the plane tree not the chestnut tree) has many antioxidants, which reduce inflammation.  These plants should help increase the birth rate of the animals that consumed them. \n\n###Verse 38\nSet = yāṣaḡ = to place permanently, set or place\nGutters = rahaṭ = to hollow out, a channel, watering box, trough, by resemblance: a ringlet of hair (forming parallel lines)\nConceive = yāḥam = to be hot, figuratively: to conceive\n*Apparently Jacob set up good conditions for breeding of the sheep\n\n###Verse 39\n*The offspring of the sheep had imperfections that would be Jacob’s payment. There area several ideas as to how this worked. The plants Jacob used in the water could have caused them to bear imperfect offspring, but those may have been just for the sheep to be more likely to conceive. If you look ahead to Genesis 31:10-13 you will see that the LORD gave Jacob foreknowledge in a dream about which rams would produce the imperfect offspring\n\n###Verse 40\n*Jacob now separates out his own flock from Laban’s original parent flock. This way he can establish his own\n\n###Verse 41\nStronger = qāšar = to tie, bind, league together, conspire\n*Jacob gave the herbal medicine to the stronger (or maybe the ones that mated) of the flock to help them conceive and give birth without complications \n\n###Verse 42\nFeeble = ʿāṭap̄ = to shroud, clothe, to languish, turn aside<br>\n*Looking at the meaning of the word for stronger and feebler it may just mean the ones that coupled (stronger) and the ones that did not (feebler). So, these feeble ones (or maybe ones that did not mate), Jacob set aside to be part of Laban’s flock.\n\n###Verse 43\n*Jacob is blessed of the LORD and has greatly increased his wealth in just a few years\n\n",
      '31': "###Verse 1\nWealth = kāḇôḏ = weight (only in a good sense), splendor, copiousness, abundance, honor, glory<br>\n*Jacob overhears Laban’s sons talking about how much wealth Jacob has acquired\n\n###Verse 2\n As = tᵊmôl = time since, yesterday, figuratively: recently, formerly<br>\nBefore = šilšôm = trebly i.e., day before yesterday or 3 days ago<br>\n*Jacob sees that Laban is not happy about Jacob’s breeding program\n\n###Verse 3\n*The LORD tells Jacob it is time to return home\n\n###Verse 4\n*Jacob prepares by sending his wives out\n\n###Verse 5\n*Jacob trusts the LORD even if he cannot trust his family\n\n###Verse 6\nMight = kōaḥ = to be firm, vigor, literally: force (good or bad), figuratively: capacity, means, produce, can also be used to mean a large lizard (because of its hardiness) <br>\n*Jacob says he has served Laban faithfully. Side note (bunny trail): could the word “kōaḥ” be used to refer to dinosaurs?\n\n###Verse 7\nDeceived = hāṯal = to deride, mock, by implication: to cheat, deceive<br>\nChanged = ḥālap̄ = to slide, by implication: to hasten away, pass on, spring up, pierce or change<br>\nTimes = mōnê = something weighed out, figuratively: a portion of time, an instance, a counted number<br>\n*So, it seems that what Laban thought would be a great deal. Jacob was only allowed to use the pure white sheep to make his speckled, spotted, dark or ring-streaked sheep. But things changed once Laban saw how the LORD blessed Jacob. It seems that Laban changed the deal ten times on Jacob\n\n###Verse 8\n*This verse gives us the idea of what Jacob is talking about with Laban changing his wages. It seems that after Jacob had produced a lot of sheep Laban came to him and said something like from now on only the speckled ones will be the wages. But what happened next is that the LORD had all the flock bare only speckled young. Then once Laban saw this he went and said, no more speckled now you can have all the streaked. Then again, the LORD made it so that all the flock bore only streaked. From what we can see over the course of the next 6 years this happened 10 times\n\n####Verse 9\nHas taken = nāṣal = to snatch away, good sense: deliver, bad sense: strip or plunder<br>\n*Jacob basically explains all this to Leah and Rachel and in doing so gives all the glory to the LORD\n\n###Verse 10\nRams = ʿatûḏ = prepared, i.e. full grown, (used in two ways spoken in plural: male goats, or figuratively: Leaders of the people<br>\nGray-spotted = bārōḏ = spotted, marked, (sprinkled with hail) [root: to hail] <br>\n*Jacob explains that the LORD showed him which rams to use to produce the young that were needed. So, every time that Laban changed the deal Jacob would know which rams to use to make the type of young that he needed. Also, with all the plants he was using they would conceive more easily and the young would be healthier \n\n###Verse 11\n*The way that the LORD told Jacob which rams was through an angel in a dream\n\n###Verse 12\n*It is not super clear, Jacob was shown the rams however, it seems more likely that the LORD made the correct rams’ mate without Jacob having to do anything special other than caring for the sheep\n\n###Verse 13\nAnointed = māšaḥ = to rub with oil, i.e. to anoint, smear or paint, by implication: to consecrate<br>\n*The LORD makes clear to Jacob who he is and tells him it is time to leave and return to the promised land\n\n###Verse 14\nInheritance = naḥălâ = something inherited, abstractly: occupancy, concretely: an heirloom, or possession, generally: an estate, or property<br>\n*Remember he has been telling all this to Leah and Rachel. They then ask if there is any inheritance for them. \n\n###Verse 15\nConsidered = ḥāšaḇ = to plait, literally: to weave, generally: to fabricate, figuratively: to plot or contrive (usually in a malicious sense) also: to think, regard, value or compute<br>\nStrangers = nāḵrî = strange, alien, foreign<br>\nMoney = kesep̄ = silver, by implication: money<br>\n*I was a little confused by this at first. Everything I could find on ancient Hebrew culture says that the women cannot really own anything other than in a specific situation. If there are no male heirs then the inheritance can be passed on to the daughters but this puts restrictions on who they can marry and they are more like a temporary holder of the property until it can be transferred to her husband. But Leah and Rachel seem to be saying that there is some portion of inheritance that should be given to them but was spent by Laban. Then, I realized that they are not really following Hebrew culture yet. So, I looked into Babylonian culture which is near the area where Laban lives. And I found a few things that may shed some light on this from (https://ehistory.osu.edu/articles/marriage-ancient-mesopotamia-and-babylonia). It turns out that in Babylonian culture the wife does get a small sum that is her property to keep even if her husband dies. This sum is meant for use in running the household, and nether sons nor brothers can claim it. If the couple is to live with the bride’s father, then the sum is called “dumaki” and is paid by the husband. If, however, the wife will go live in the husband’s house then, the sum is called “sherigtu” and is paid by the bride’s household. Sometimes the bride received a special gift at the time of engagement called “nudunnu”. On top of all this there was another present, this one is not named, of gold, silver, lead and sometimes food for the wedding feast. These gifts are all considered the property of the wife and cannot be claimed by the family of ether side and cannot even be reclaimed in the event of a divorce. I don’t know but it makes since to me that this would be what Leah and Rebecca are talking about with inheritance that should have been given to them. Especially because the word translated to money in this verse specifically means sliver.\n\n###Verse 16\nRiches = ʿōšer = wealth<br>\n*They are fine with Jacob taking what the LORD has blessed him with, but it seems to be a little more than that. It seems that Leah and Rachel feel that they should have gotten even more\n\n###Verse 17\n*Jacob loads up his family\n\n###Verse 18 \nCarried away = nāhaḡ = to drive forth, lead, carry away, conduct<br>\nHad gained = qinyān = creation, creatures, acquisition, purchase, wealth<br>\n*Jacob gathers all his possessions and livestock and prepares for the journey home\n\n###Verse 19\nSheer = gāzaz = to cut off, specifically: to shear a flock or shave hair, figuratively: to destroy an enemy<br>\nIdols = tᵊrāp̄îm = a healer, Teraphim family idol, (this is plural word that can be used to mean a singular thing) <br>\n*In classical rabbinical literature this is often translated as “disgraceful things”. According to the Targum Jonathan (which is basically a translation and encyclopedia of the Talmud written, by rabbis, in the 1500s), Teraphim were human skulls, usually of infants but not always, that have been, shaved and preserved and placed on a golden plate with engraved magic words. It was thing hung on a wall and people believed that the Teraphim would talk to you. This was used mostly for telling the future. The practice seems to be common in the Babylonian area and this is near the area Laban lives in. The use of Teraphim did bleed into Israelite culture from time to time as well.\n\n###Verse 20\nDid not = bᵊlî = failure, nothing or destruction, wearing out<br>\n*It seems that Jacob snuck away while Laban was out shearing his sheep\n\n###Verse 21\nGilead = gilʿāḏ = rocky region, a region east of the Jordan, Hitchcock: the heap or mass of testimony<br>\n*Jacob crosses the river and gets some distance between him and Laban\n\n###Verse 22\n*Laban didn’t find out for 3 days that Jacob has left\n\n###Verse 23\n*Laban chases down Jacob for the next 7 days and catches him in the mountains of Gilead. Gilead remember is a little east of the Jordan river. And Haran where Laban came from is north west of Babylon. So, we can see here that it takes 7 days to get from Haran to Gilead when pushing yourself to catch someone. And 10 days if you have a caravan and livestock and are running away quickly. Google says 150 hours of walking that’s over 6 days with no sleep. Seems like 7 days can be done with people that know what they are doing and have animals to ride.\n\n###Verse 24\nGood = ṭôḇ = good (in the widest sense) can be used as an adjective or a noun<br>\nBad = raʿ = bad, evil<br>\nSpeak = dāḇar = to arrange, figuratively: speak, rarely: subdue<br>\n*Once again, we have the LORD commanding Laban to speak nether good or bad. Here this is concerning Jacob. Why does the LORD say not to speak good. I really had trouble understanding why the LORD would say that. I came across as Hebrew word sturdy on the word “raʿ” translated to bad or evil and in that study, it also mentions some insight on the meaning of “ṭôḇ”, good. It’s found here: https://www.chaimbentorah.com/2020/09/hebrew-word-study-evil-ra/ and sheds some light on this phrase for me. It turns out that there are about 10 words based on “raʿ” that all are different forms of evil. Chaim Bentorah says that the word is weird because it consists of only 2 letters. And Hebrew words are supposed to be 3 or more letters. He gives a few reasons as to why this would be. First the word is based on an Egyptian word ra for the name of one of their gods. It also turns out that the words that use “raʿ” as a root just add a letter at the end and make it mean a more specific form of evil. Chaim Bentorah gives examples of adding V makes the word mean evil of hunger and starvation, while adding a D means evil that causes you to lose control, adding an L is the evil of drunkenness and confusion and adding M makes the word men the evil of anger and rage. The Hebrews even have a form of the word where they add an A making the word mean the evil of worshiping another god. His personal view is that “raʿ” is used to mean all forms of evil. Chaim also mentions the opposite word is “ṭôḇ” translated good means to be in harmony with someone or something. To me this implies that good is harmony and evil would be disharmony. One more word to look at an that is “dāḇar”. This word translated to speak 840 times in the KJV and another 261 times it is a synonym of the word speak. I think that here though it is more appropriate to consider the full meaning of the word. If we keep in mind that the word technically means to arrange and can sometimes even have the connotation of subduing then this passage makes more since. Now back to the verse the LORD tells Laban do not speak/arrange/subdue good(harmony) or evil(disharmony) to Jacob. Looking at it this way it seems that the LORD is telling Laban that he will not be making any arrangements with Jacob. Laban will nether align himself with Jacob nor work against him. The LORD seems to wants to keep Jacob (aka Israel) set apart from the other people that live around them. \n\n###Verse 25\nOvertook = nāśaḡ = to reach (used literally or figuratively), overtake<br>\nPitched = tāqaʿ = to clatter, clap hands, clang an instrument, by analogy, to drive (a nail or tent pin) by implication: to become a bondsman (by clasping hands) <br>\n*Laban shows up and both groups set up camp\n\n###Verse 26\n*Laban seems pretty upset and uses some harsh language about how Jacob left\n\n###Verse 27\nJoy = śimḥâ = glee, blithesomeness, gladness, joy, mirth<br>\nSongs = šîr = a song, abstractly: singing<br>\nTimbrel = tōp̄ = a tambourine<br>\nHarp = kinnôr = to twang, a harp<br>\n*Laban says that he would have sent Jacob off with a celebration. But we know from past experience that what Laban says is not always what Laban means\n\n###Verse 28\nAllow = nāṭaš = to pound or smite, by implication: to disperse, leave, forsake or permit<br>\nFoolishly = sāḵal = to be silly, be foolish or a fool<br>\n*Laban calls Jacob foolish so it seems pretty clear that the LORD is speaking to Laban about his actions rather than his speech\n\n###Verse 29\nHarm = raʿ = bad, evil<br>\nSpoke/saying = 'āmar = to say<br>\nSpeak = dāḇar = to arrange, figuratively: speak, rarely: subdue<br>\n*I think here we have more confirmation that the LORD is concerned with Laban actions toward Jacob rather than what he says \n\n###Verse 30\nGreatly long = kāsap̄ = to become pale, by implication: to pine after or to fear<br>\n*There are two Hebrew words used twice in this passage. “hālaḵ” twice back-to-back is translated to “you have surely gone” and “kāsap̄” also twice back-to-back is translated to “you greatly long”. Again, normally when the same word is placed twice then it is giving emphasis but this verse has two double words. So is Laban saying that was a really far walk and Jacob is really pale (aka really wants to go home), or maybe Laban is just really upset and emphasizing because of that. Either way, Laban accuses Jacob of stealing from him\n\n###Verse 31\n*Jacob seems to skip over the stealing thing and he tells Laban that he was afraid that Laban would not let his daughters leave. Looking at Laban’s track record that is not an unfounded assumption. This also implies that Jacob knows nothing about any stolen idols\n\n###Verse 32\n*Now Jacob addresses the stolen goods\n\n###Verse 33\n*Laban looks for his idols systematically\n\n###Verse 34\nSaddle = kar = something plump, a ram (full grown and fat), a meadow, also a puffy pad for a saddle<br>\n*Laban gets to Rachel who hid the idols (preserved heads) by sitting on them\n\n###Verse 35\nSearched = ḥāp̄aś = to seek, to conceal oneself (let someone seek you), to mask<br>\n*So, Laban searches but does not find them\n\n###Verse 36\nTrespass = pešaʿ = a revolt, a transgression<br>\nSin = ḥaṭṭā'āṯ = an offence, occasion, sacrifice, expiation, an offender [root: to miss] <br>\nHotly Pursued = dālaq = to flame, burn<br>\n*Jacob is upset that Laban would race over here as if chasing a thief when he has done nothing wrong. Remember he didn’t know what Rachel took\n\n###Verse 37\n*Tells Laban to show whatever he has found stolen and prove his claim\n\n###Verse 38\nEwes = rāḥēl = to journey, a ewe, female sheep<br>\n*This verse and verse 41 show that Jacob was with Laban for 20 years total and he points out to Laban how much Laban’s own flock and household has benefited from Jacob’s labor over these years\n\n###Verse 39\nTorn = ṭᵊrēp̄â = prey, i.e.: flocks devoured by animals<br>\nBore the loss = ḥāṭā' = to miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn<br>\nRequired it = bāqaš = to search out, seek, by implication: to strive after<br>\n*Jacob points out that not only was Laban blessed by Jacob’s labor, but any time there was a loss Jacob bore the burden of it. Also note that the phrase bore the loss is translated from the Hebrew word meaning to miss, which is often translated as sin\n\n###Verse 40\nDrought = ḥōreḇ = drought, desolation, dryness<br>\nFrost = qeraḥ = ice, hail, by resemblance: rock crystal<br>\nDeparted = nāḏaḏ = to wave to and fro, flutter, figuratively: to rove, depart, stray, wander, causatively: to drive away, retreat, flee<br>\n*Rain or shine he kept working\n\n###Verse 41\n*After Jacob tells Laban about how he has done the right thing for Laban. Then Laban turns around and does not do the right thing\n\n###Verse 42\nUnless = lûlē' = if not, unless<br>\nFear = paḥaḏ = a sudden alarm, the object feared, dread, [root: to shake] <br>\nEmpty handed = rêqām = emptily, figuratively: ineffectually, subjectively: undeservedly<br>\nLabor = yᵊḡîaʿ = toil, work, produce, property<br>\n*So, this is the first time we see “paḥaḏ”, one of the fear words. This one is differentiated from the other fear words because it has the implication that you are shaking with fear. And it seems that this kind of fear is what Laban has about the LORD and this is why he treated Jacob somewhat fairly rather than just completely taking advantage of Jacob\n\n###Verse 43\n*We can see from this verse that Laban sees Leah, Rachel and their children, along with all the livestock, as his. This confirms to me that Laban would have done as Jacob said if it were not for the LORD stopping Laban from doing so\n\n###Verse 44\n*Laban is fearful and but cannot try to ally with Jacob or cause him harm so the best think Laban can come up with is that he will make a covenant with Jacob so that Jacob will not be able to attack Laban later\n\n###Verse 45\n*Jacob sets up a stone as a marker. This is the second time that Jacob does this he did once before at Beth-el when he made a covenant with the LORD\n\n###Verse 46\nGather = lāqaṭ = to pick up, to gather, to glean<br>\nHeap = gal = something rolled, heap of stone or dung, by analogy: a spring of water<br>\n*Not only does Jacob set up a stone but all the people set a stone there to make a giant pile of stones this will now mark the border of Jacob and Laban\n\n###Verse 47\nJegar Sahadutha = yᵊḡar śāhăḏûṯā' = witness heap or heap of the testimony [roots: to gather and to testify] <br>\nGaleed = galʿēḏ = witness heap or heap of testimony [roots: heap and witness] <br>\n*Interestingly both of these come from two root words and for both the two root words mean gather a heap and witness or testimony but both root words are different from the root words of the other. In other words Laban called it “gather the pillars of testimony” while Jacob called it “witness heap”\n\n###Verse 48\nHeap = gal = something rolled, heap of stone or dung, by analogy: a spring of water<br>\nWitness = ʿēḏ = a witness, abstractly: testimony, specifically: a recorder or prince<br>\n*Now Laban begins to speak and he starts by using the version of the name that Jacob says to me this is strategy, he starts by giving in to Jacob so that when he asks for something then Jacob will be more willing to give in to him\n\n###Verse 49\nMizpah = miṣpâ = watchtower<br>\nWatch = ṣāp̄â = to lean forward, peer into the distance, by implication: to observe, await, spy or keep watch<br>\nAbsent = sāṯar = to hide, conceal<br>\n*Couple of things here first I wonder if this is where the Jewish word Seder comes from, “sāṯar” sounds similar and means to hide or conceal which seems to me that this is what the LORD did when making it so that the Hebrew people were hidden from the angel of death. Second notice what Laban does now he adds another name to the stones calling them watchtower. And notice that he says the LORD will watch here at this tower. Now the question is, why does Laban say this?\n\n###Verse 50\n*And Laban begins to answer the question. It seems that Laban is invoking the name of the LORD so make sure that Jacob knows that the LORD is watching. Jacob cannot marry another…\n\n###Verse 51\n*To me this verse points to the beliefs of ancient pagans. They believed that the gods inhabited physical objects like the preserved head of an ancestor or a pile of stones. It seems that Laban is also trying to hide from the LORD and saying well He is in that pile of rocks here at this place and is watching you. To me Laban seems to be thinking that if I leave this area and go back home then the LORD will be here with Jacob and away from Laban\n\n###Verse 52\n*This verse seems like further proof that Laban is trying to use the LORD and the stones to keep Jacob from causing Laban harm. Laban knows that right now he has the power to harm Jacob but cannot. Laban also knows that he cannot try and talk Jacob into returning or make some sort of deal with Jacob. Laban knows he cannot take Jacob’s wives and children back home to hold them hostage and force Jacob to do what Laban wants. All of these things have been stopped by the LORD speaking to Laban. So, Laban is making the only deal he can which is I will leave you alone and not cross this border if you leave me alone and do not cross this border. I have noticed in life that people often assume that others will act like they do. Laban has been untrustworthy and manipulative every time we see him, so I think that Laban assumes that Jacob will be the same. This would mean that when Jacob gets home to Isaac who Laban knows is powerful then Jacob may return to get revenge on Laban for the way he treated Jacob. So, to me Laban is trying to get Jacob to see that the LORD is here and watching to make sure that Jacob follows this deal\n\n###Verse 53\n*Jacob agrees because this is what he wanted in the first place. We can see here that the LORD knows the heart and knows how to give Jacob the freedom he wants and at the same time He has the power to place fear in Laban’s heart so that this freedom will not only happen but Laban thinks it is his own idea\n\n###Verse 54\nOffered = zāḇaḥ = to slaughter an animal, usually in sacrifice<br>\nSacrifice = zeḇaḥ = to slaughter, by implication sacrifice<br>\n*They sealed the covenant with the sacrifice. Now it is not specifically stated here, other than above in verse 44 when Laban says they will make a covenant (pass between flesh of slaughtered animals), but it makes since to me that they would perform the custom of the time when making a covenant by passing between the flesh of these animals they have sacrificed\n\n###Verse 55\n*Laban says his final goodbyes and departs\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '32': "###Verse 1\nAngles = mal'āḵ = to dispatch as deputy, a messenger, specifically: messenger of God or angel<br>\n*Jacob heads out from his confrontation with Laban at Geleed and is met by angles\n\n###Verse 2\nMahanaim = maḥănayim = two camps, double camp<br>\n*This is pretty close to Geleed. Just head a little south and west into the valley just before crossing the Jordan. So, Jacob is about to enter the promise land but has not yet\n\n###Verse 3\nMessengers = mal'āḵ = to dispatch as deputy, a messenger, specifically: messenger of God or angel<br>\nSeir = śēʿîr = hairy, shaggy, rough<br>\nEdom = 'ĕḏōm = red<br>\n*Jacob sends messengers to his brother Esau in Edom. Now remember Seir (city) and Edom (nation) are basically just descriptions of what Esau looks like and he is the one that starts the people of that area. So, at the moment it is just Esau and his household that live in Seir. Later there will be a nation of Edomites that have descended from Esau living there. The area is south of Jacobs current position in Mahanaim. This is outside the promised land; Edom is basically south east of the dead sea. Another interesting thing is that the word for the messengers that Jacob sent is the same word for the Angels that Jacob met. So, the question is, were angels sent to talk to Esau or were these different human messengers sent by Jacob? I lean toward the idea that these are Jacob’s own human messengers, but it is interesting to consider the possibility that angels were sent. In Hebrew verse three says “send Jacob messenger/angel in face toward Esau brother firm ground hairy(Seir) spread out field red(Edom)”\n\n###Verse 4\nCommand = ṣāvâ = to constitute, enjoin, give charge, command, order<br>\n*Here is why it seems much more likely that Jacob is talking to his own messengers rather than angels\n\n###Verse 5\nOxen = šôr = bullock, head of cattle<br>\n*Jacob starts by just having his messengers tell Laban that will be returning with lots of stuff\n\n###Verse 6\n*The messengers return saying that Esau is coming with 400 men to meet Jacob\n\n###Verse 7\nAfraid = yārē' = to fear, morally: to revere, causatively: to frighten (fear some power greater than yourself) <br>\nDistressed = yāṣar = to press, be narrow, bind, be restricted, scant, cramped figuratively: to be in distress<br>\nDivided = ḥāṣâ = to cut, split in two, to halve<br>\nCompanies = maḥănê = an encampment, an army (travelers, soldiers, could even be animals) <br>\n*Jacob is scared that Esau is still mad at him. Remember when Jacob left 20 years ago, he was fleeing for his life from his brother. So, Jacob makes a plan where divides his people into two companies (which by the way is the root word of Mahanaim what Jacob named the area) So, it seems to me that Jacob named this place the place where we split into two groups\n\n###Verse 8\nEscape = pᵊlêṭâ = deliverance, an escaped portion<br>\n*Here we see Jacob’s plan he is splitting his forces so that if Esau attacks, then one portion will be the sacrifice and the other may survive\n\n###Verse 9\n*Now Jacob prays. Notice that he starts his prayer by repeating the promise that the LORD has made to Jacob. He is referencing Genesis 31:3 when the LORD says to Jacob that he should leave Laban and return home\n\n###Verse 10\nI am not worthy of the least = qāṭōn = to diminish, be small, insignificant<br>\n*Next Jacob says that he is not worthy of all that the LORD has done for him and Jacob recognizes that the LORD keeps his promises. Jacob uses the example of saying that he had nothing but a staff with him when he left 20 years ago. This explains why Jacob had to work 7 years for each of his wives, and to me gives the reason why he sent his messengers ahead to tell Esau that he was returning with wealth. I think Jacob is letting Esau know that he won’t be coming back begging for a handout\n\n###Verse 11\n*Now Jacob asks the LORD to keep him and his family safe\n\n###Verse 12\n*Jacob finishes his prayer by remembering another promise of the LORD, which references Genesis 22:17 and is a promise given to Abraham about his descendants but then it also connects to Genesis 28:4 where Isaac gives Jacob the true blessing from the LORD which passes on that promise from Abraham to Jacob. We can also compare this prayer to the prayer found in Genesis 28:20-28. The first prayer in chapter 28 says is where Jacob prays in bargain form. Jacob says that if the LORD will feed him, clothe him, and return him home safely then the LORD will be his God. And Jacob will give a tenth of everything to the LORD. Now we see that Jacob has grown in his relationship with the LORD. Rather than trying to make a deal with the LORD he just trusts that the LORD will keep his promises. To me this shows a growth in Jacob’s faith and again it happed through the same process that Abraham went through. The LORD not only kept promises toward Jacob but greatly blessed him much more than he could have hoped for. This faithfulness of the LORD is what grows faith. The same is true for us today\n\n###Verse 13\nPresent = minḥâ = to apportion, bestow, a donation, gift, euphemistically: tribute, sacrificial offering<br>\n*After praying that night Jacob let’s the LORD decides what to give to Esau. Whatever of his animals that come to his hand he will give to Esau\n\n###Verse 14-15\nCows = pārâ = a heifer, cow<br>\n*It seems to be a very substantial gift that he will be sending to Esau\n\n###Verse 16\nDrove = ʿēḏer = arrangement, muster, flock, herd <br>\nDistance = revaḥ = room, space, interval, figuratively: deliverance, respite, relief\n*Jacob decides to split his present into parts so that Esau can get a succession of gifts not just one gift\n\n###Verse 17-18\nMeets = pāḡaš = to come in contact with, meet, encounter<br>\n*Jacob tells his first messenger what to say when he meets Esau\n\n###Verse 19-20\nAppease = kāp̄ar = to cover (specifically with tar) figuratively: to expiate, condone, placate or cancel<br>\n*Jacob gives the other droves similar instructions\n\n###Verse 21\n*Jacob spends another night. It seems he wants to have Esau thinking that Jacob will be the next thing right behind one of the droves. I believe Jacob is thinking that if he can make Esau anticipate seeing Jacob but then getting a present instead that it may dissipate any anger that Esau may still be holding onto\n\n###Verse 22\nFord = maʿăḇār = a crossing-place, abstractly: transit<br>\nJabbok = yabōq = emptying, pouring forth<br>\n*The Jabbok River is east of the Jordan about half way between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. Jacob and his family head south on the east side of the Jordan to meet Esau at night. And they get to the crossing last of all after the caravan of presents and the other party that was split off and sent on ahead. Now he is about to cross with his family\n\n###Verse 23\nBrook = naḥal = a stream, especially a winter torrent, by implication: narrow valley, or mine shaft<br>\n*His family crosses first then he is the last one\n\n###Verse 24\nLeft = yāṯar = to jut over, to exceed, by implication: to excel, intransitively: to remain or be left, causatively: to leave, cause to abound, preserve<br>\nMan = 'îš = a man, a male person<br>\nWrestled = 'āḇaq = to float away, to grapple, wrestle<br>\n*It’s some time in the night Jacob’s family has just crossed a river in the dark. They are waiting for Jacob as he is the last to cross. Jacob is in fear of his brother that Esau will kill him and his family and take everything he has. Then out of nowhere some guy attacks Jacob and wrestles with him\n\n###Verse 25\nOut of joint = yāqaʿ = to sever oneself, by implication: to be dislocated, figuratively: to abandon, causatively: to impale<br>\n*Jacob is winning (at 97ish) so the man dislocates Jacob’s hip\n\n###Verse 26\n*The man asks Jacob to let him go and Jacob says bless me first, this shows that Jacob was wrestling not to keep God away but to keep him close, in a way this is an example of wrestling with sin\n\n###Verse 27\nJacob = yaʿăqōḇ = heel holder, supplanter<br>\n*The man asks Jacob his name\n\n###Verse 28\nIsrael = yiśrā'ēl = God prevails, he will rule as God, Hitchcock: who prevails with God<br>\n*The man blesses Jacob and changes his name to Israel because he has struggled with God and men and prevailed. Why did Jacob wrestle with God and why did GOD change his name to Israel? From what I could find most people think the wrestling match is a symbolization of Israel’s life and that the LORD changed his name to reflect that he has struggled with the LORD. One thing to note here is that Israel was not struggling against the LORD but struggling to keep the LORD close. This to me feels like a physical representation of our own struggle against our flesh and trying to hold on to the things of the sprit. Thinking of the end of Galatians Chapter 5\n\n###Verse 29\n*Israel then asks for the name of the man and the man just answers him with a question\n\n###Verse 30\nPeniel = pᵊnû'ēl = facing God, face of God, Hitchcock: face or vision of God, that sees God<br>\n*Israel tells us here that it was God that he wrestled with\n\n###Verse 31\nRose = zāraḥ = to irradiate, to rise, specifically: to appear<br>\nLimped = ṣālaʿ = to curve, to limp<br>\n*Israel comes away from the encounter with a limp. Why did God injure Israel’s hip? The only thing that makes since to me is that this would humble Israel and show him that there is a cost for following the LORD. This reminds me of the idea of carrying the cross\n\n###Verse 32\nMuscle = gîḏ = a strip of flesh, sinew, tendon<br>\nShrank = nāšê = failure, rheumatic, crippled (only time this word appears in the bible) <br>\n*This is why Hebrews don’t eat the back part of the animal?\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

This too will show Esau that the Jacob he used to know has changed\n\n###Verse 9\nEnough = raḇ = abundant, much, many, great<br>\n*Esau says that he has no need for the gift of Jacob\n\n###Verse 10\nI have seen/as though I had seen = rā'â = to see, literally or figuratively, many applications<br>\nAnd you were pleased with me = rāṣâ = to be pleased with, specifically: to satisfy a debt<br>\n*Here we see Jacob insisting that Esau take his gift. Most biblical commenters seem to attribute this to cleverness on Jacob’s part. The idea is that if Esau accepts the gift, then kills Jacob later it would cause Esau trouble because the people would not be able to trust Esau. I see something a little different here. Remember the gift that Jacob sent to Esau was from what came to his hand the night that he prayed to the LORD for what to do about Esau. So, to me this gift was chosen by the LORD as a gift for Esau and Jacob is just following the LORD’s plan. If Jacob were to accept Esau’s claim and take back the gift then in my opinion, he would be going against the LORD\n\n###Verse 11\n*Even here Jacob says that it is because of the LORD that Jacob is giving the gift to Esau\n\n###Verse 12\n*Although Esau doesn’t directly say it, the presumption is that Esau is inviting Jacob to live with him in Edom\n\n###Verse 13\nNursing = ʿûl = give milk, to suckle<br>\nDrive them hard = dāp̄aq = to knock, beat by analogy: to press severely<br>\n*Jacob uses the excuse that he needs to go slow for the young so he cannot move his group to quickly\n\n###Verse 14\nLead = nāhal = to run with a sparkle, to flow, transitively: to conduct, guide, lead, by inference: to protect, refresh<br>\nSlowly = 'aṭ = to move softly, gently, gentleness, also used as a noun: a necromancer (because they speak soft incantations) <br>\nLivestock = mᵊlā'ḵâ = deputyship, ministry, generally: employment, work, occupation<br>\nPace/Endure = reḡel = a foot, by implication: a step, euphemistically: pudenda<br>\n*Jacob says that he will lead his group gently so as not to overwork their feet. But he says to Esau don’t let me slow you down. You go on ahead and we will catch up. Now we know this is not true because in a mere 10 days Jacob drove his group hard from Haran to Gilead when running from Laban\n\n###Verse 15\nLeave = yāṣaḡ = to place permanently<br>\n*Esau says he will leave some men to escort Jacob. The word he used carries the idea of permanently leaving men with Jacob. Jacob does not want an escort so he tells Esau that he will be fine on his own, after all he made it this far\n\n###Verse 16\n*Esau relents and goes on ahead\n\n###Verse 17\nSuccoth = sukôṯ = booths, Hitchcock: tents, tabernacles<br>\nBooths = sukâ = a hut, lair, booth, thicket, (inter-woven structure) <br>\n*Succoth is in the land of Gad east of the Jordan and north of Jabbok rivers. We know from Genesis 32:22 that Jacob was already south of the Jabbok. So, it seems that Jacob had no intention of following Esau south to Seir in Edom. As soon as Esau leaves, he goes back across the Jabbok and sets up camp and even some more permanent buildings. Don’t know how long Jacob stays here\n\n###Verse 18\nShechem = šᵊḵem = back, shoulder, ridge, Hitchcock: part, portion, back early in the morning<br>\n*Jacob makes his way back into the promise land. He gets to Shechem which is on the west side of the Jordan fairly far north of where Jerusalem will be. The section says that he came from Padan Aram, which is where Laban lives. Yet further evidence that going to see Esau was a detour from the original planned Journey\n\n###Verse 19\nPieces of Money = qᵊśîṭâ = to weigh out, an ingot, an unknown unit if value<br>\n*What is this money, the short answer nobody knows. The consensus is that it is some sort of metal that has been broken in to coins or ingots. Some say it is sliver and some say the metal has some sort of lamb shape stamped on it. Some say it is trading lambs for equal value of 100 pieces of a metal, usually silver. The word is only found in 3 places in the entire Bible. They are here, Joshua 24:32 and Job 42:11. In Joshua it talks about how Josephs bones were buried at Shechem which Jacob bought for 100 pieces of money. So, it is just a historical report of the original use of the word. In Job it is at the very end when Job is restored to health and all the people come to celebrate and each of the people give Job a piece of money and a gold ring. From what I can see all three instances could be lambs of a certain value given, or could be coins or ingots of silver or otherwise. One common theme to note in all three stories is there is a sense of coming home after a trial and being in the presence of the LORD. Jacob started out by fleeing for his life from his brother, then had to live the life of a virtual slave one of the with no possessions to his name except his clothing and staff. In the second story a great famine causes the children of Israel to be destitute and become slaves in Egypt, the lowest members of society with no possessions of their own. Job has hardship and sickness take everything from him until he is left with basically nothing but the clothing on his back and dust. Maybe the bible uses this word for money here, rather than the more common word for silver that we have seen before, for a reason. Maybe the LORD is using this word to bring to our attention the value of coming back to the LORD after a trial. In all three cases the trial was caused by the LORD for a reason. And in all cases the people involved continued to trust in the LORD after the trial rather than blame him or reject the LORD for the trial that they went through. Maybe the value of the money is unknown because it lets us see the greater value of what the people gained by going through the trial and coming out closer the LORD than they were before. In all three instances the people are blessed and given great undeserved wealth solely by the LORD. Untimely, I think these three stories have a connection by showing that our life in this world is morally destitute and we are stuck in slavery to the flesh. And the only solution is the abundant blessing of the LORD given solely by him at the cross so that we can experience the great wealth and blessing the LORD has in store for we who trust in him\n\n###Verse 20\nEl = 'ēl = strength, mighty, especially: the Almighty (can be used for God or god) <br>\nElohe = 'ĕlōhîm = Plural gods, specifically: the supreme God, occasionally: magistrates<br>\nIsrael = yiśrā'ēl = God prevails, he will rule as God, Hitchcock: who prevails with God<br>\n*We have seen all these before but if you put them all together then Jacob called the place “God the Supreme God who Prevails”.

      '34': "sunday-school-notes.vercel.app\n\nGenesis 34\n\n###Verse 1\n*Dinah goes to make friends\n\n###Verse 2\nHivite = ḥiûî = villagers, a villager<br>\nViolated = ʿānâ = to depress, (used literal or figurative) <br>\n*Dinah gets attacked by Shechem himself. Remember the area that they came to was called Shechem. Shechem’s dad Hamor is basically the leader of that area. In this time period there were a couple of customs that we would find distasteful today. First, it was fairly common in that time period for a man to take a woman that he desired, then afterward ask the family for the bride price of the woman that he had taken, this seems to be what happened here. Usually this was done with the woman’s consent, however this may not be the case for Dinah. We have a few clues the first being the word “ʿānâ” translated to violated means to depress someone. Later words translated to defiled and harlot will be used. These words plus the reaction of Jacob and his sons seem to indicate that Dinah was taken against her will. There are however some scholar’s that says Dinah was consenting to the relationship. Which brings us to the next point, the age of consent. From what I could find the age of consent in the ancient Hebrew and Canaanite culture was as young as 12 for girls and 14 for boys. The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that girls have a growth spirt a couple of years before boys do. So, now the question becomes how old was Dinah? The bible is not really clear on this however, I have found a range of ages anywhere from 7 to 16. I think we can get a more accurate number but it will take some digging. To start with, remember we calculated that she is just a few months older than Joseph, which would make Dinah about 6 years and 3 months old when Jacob left Laban, add just 10 days for Laban to catch up with them then there is a meeting with Esau. This seems like it didn’t take long but we don’t know how long it did take. Next Jacob stays in Succoth long enough to build a house (Genesis 33:17). After this he moves to Shechem and lives there long enough to build an altar (Genesis 33:20). At some point here is when Dinah is taken. So, it is possible that she was 7 but that would be the minimum age she could have been. Then we also see that Joseph was sold into slavery at age 17 (Genesis 37:2) So, Dinah was also about 17 at that time. But before that age they move to Bethel from Shechem, then move from Bethel and Rachel has another child. This means the absolute oldest Dinah could be is 16. In verse 34:1 it says she went out to see the daughters of the land, so she had to be old enough to do that. Because of this and the customs at the time anything under 12 seems extremely unlikely. We can look at other clues in the story for example Simeon and Levi kill bunch of people shortly after that. If Dinah were 7 years old then Simeon would have been 12 and Levi would have been 11. This doesn’t seem like the age of 2 brothers able to wield swords and kill an entire village. To me 16 or older is more likely which is what Levi would have been if she was 12. I thought we may be able to look to Benjamin to see if that can help us, but there is just no way of knowing for sure how old Benjamin is any more accurately than we have already pinpointed Dinah’s age. Long story short she is most likely around 12 to 14 years with a less likely but possible range of 10 to 16 years old\n\n###Verse 3\nSoul = nep̄eš = a breathing creature, vital animal, living being, person, literally: body, figuratively: mental, desire, appetite, emotion or passion<br>\nYoung Woman = naʿărâ = a girl (from infancy to adolescence) <br>\n*In the Hebrew the word “nep̄eš” that is often translated to soul. However, the meaning of the word is a little different than what we usually mean today when we use the word soul. They meant the physical body and thoughts. So, I read this as he had a strong physical lust for Dinah.\n\n###Verse 4\n*Shechem goes to his dad to get what he wants\n\n###Verse 5\nDefiled = ṭāmē' = to be foul, be or become unclean<br>\n*Jacob hears about the incident with Shechem and his daughter but Jacob waits before deciding what to do\n\n###Verse 6\n*Hamor goes to speak with Jacob so that he can see about getting Jacob’s daughter for his son\n\n###Verse 7\nGrieved = ʿāṣaḇ = to carve, fabricate, fashion, to worry, pain or anger<br>\nDisgraceful Thing = nᵊḇālâ = foolishness, wickedness, a crime, by extension: punishment<br>\n*When Dinah’s brothers hear it, they are very upset\n\n###Verse 8\nLongs = ḥāšaq = to cling, join, love, delight in<br>\n*Hamor tries to smooth things over by saying that his son really likes her\n\n###Verse 9\nMarriages = ḥāṯan = to give away in marriage, to contract affinity by marriage<br>\n*Hamor then tries to entice them by saying look my son can marry you daughter and your son’s can marry our daughters\n\n###Verse 10\n*Hamor goes on to say that Jacob and his family can be part of the community\n\n###Verse 11\n*Now Shechem himself speaks up and asks how he can be a part of Jacob’s family\n\n###Verse 12\nDowry = mōhar = a price for wife<br>\nGift = matān = a present, gift<br>\n*Shechem basically says name your price. Note the word for Dowry is used 3 times total in the bible and Gift is used 5 times\n\n###Verse 13\n*Jacob’s sons seem to take the drivers seat in discussions with Hamor and Shechem. Jacob seems to be relatively silent in this section. Some people seem to think that shows wisdom because he is keeping his cards close. Others say he is in shock at what happened to his daughter and couldn’t speak. Neither of these seem quite right to me. I don’t really have a good explanation as to why he would remain silent other than maybe that was just a part of his personality. Jacob tends to take the easy way out. Look what happened with his marriage. Rather than rock the boat and demand that Laban keep up his end of the deal and give him Rachel, Jacob just resigns himself to working another 7 years. When he thinks it is time to part ways with Laban he just sneaks away. Here rather than getting involved in a confrontational negotiation about a difficult subject, Jacob just fades into the background and lets others handle it. Yet when Jacob has confrontation within his family like later in this chapter in verse 40 or when Joseph dies, he shows a much stronger response. These actions kind of remind me of an INFP. Maybe Jacob’s silence just comes from that\n\n###Verse 14\n*Jacob’s sons say that for them to intermarry the people need to be circumcised\n\n###Verse 15\nConsent = 'ôṯ = to come, implication: to assent or consent<br>\nAs we are = kᵊmô = like, thus, so, as<br>\n*But the sons of Jacob say not only Shechem but all the men of Shechem need to be circumcised. Jacob’s sons use a word that means to be like us\n\n###Verse 16\n*Here is where we see the root of the problem. Remember back in Genesis 31:3 where does the LORD call Jacob to go? Back to his father. Jacob however does not go there he goes to Shechem which is well north of Bethel (where Jacob made his covenant with the LORD) and where Isaac is still living. The LORD has consistently said to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that they are to be set apart from the people of this area. Each of them married from Haran and the LORD has told them not to join with the Canaanites. If Jacob had obeyed the LORD, he would not have endangered his daughter with what seems to be a normal custom of the Canaanite people. And here now Jacob seems to be consenting to becoming one people with the Canaanites\n\n###Verse 17\n*There is a carrot and a stick to the offer of joining people\n\n###Verse 18\nHamor = ḥămôr = male donkey<br>\nShechem = šᵊḵem = back, shoulder<br>\n*I think the names of Hamor and Shechem are somewhat fitting. Their behavior is very like the behavior of someone we would call a male donkey although most would use a cruder term beginning with the word Jack… As far as Shechem he has the burden on his shoulders as he is bringing the message back and convincing his people to do something that will ultimately get them killed. Seems to be a large burden to carry on his shoulders\n\n###Verse 19\nDelighted = ḥāp̄ēṣ = to incline, by implication: to bend, figuratively: to be pleased with, desire, delight in<br>\n*Here we get some insight into what Shechem was thinking. First of all, he seems to really like Dinah. We don’t get any insight into how she felt about the situation. Second, the passage tells us that Shechem is more honorable than all the household of his father. If Shechem was the most honorable and he raped Dinah then it is clear to me that at least in the minds of the people of Shechem, he must have done everything honorably. Which is more evidence that Dinah was of marring age which was 12 or more in Shechem’s culture. More importantly, if the way he treated Dinah was honorable then we can see why the LORD does not want Jacob and his family to mix with these people\n\n###Verse 20\n*Shechem and Hamor go to the gate to try and convince the people\n\n###Verse 21\nLarge = rāḥāḇ = roomy, in any or every direction, can be used literal or figurative<br>\n*They give reasons why they should become one people with the Israelites\n\n###Verse 22\n*Here it is stated again the plan is that these Canaanites will become one people with the Israelites\n\n###Verse 23\nLivestock = miqnê = something bought, property, livestock, abstractly: acquisition<br>\nProperty = qinyān = creation, acquisition, purchase, wealth<br>\n*Now we see more insight into how they convince the people. The people believe they will be absorbing Jacob and his household into themselves rather than the other way around. This would go completely against the LORD\n\n###Verse 24\n*The men agree and everyone gets circumcised. Remember this is a covenantal act, this is an outward expression of faith\n\n###Verse 25\nIn pain = kā'aḇ = to feel pain, by implication: to grieve, figuratively: to spoil<br>\nBoldly = beṭaḥ = a place of refuge, abstractly: safety, secure, trustworthy<br>\n*Simeon and Levi ages likely 20 to 18 and 19 to 17 respectively, take advantage of the pain of circumcision and kill everyone\n\n###Verse 26\n*They also free Dinah in the process and take her home\n\n###Verse 27\nSlain = ḥālāl = pierced (especially to death), figuratively: polluted<br>\nPlundered = bāzaz = to plunder, spoil<br>\n*Then they proceed to plunder the city. Some, biblical scholars say that this is the rest of Jacob’s sons. I however, read this as still just Simeon and Levi\n\n###Verse 28\n*Here we get a list of some of the things taken\n\n###Verse 29\nWealth = ḥayil = a force, an army, wealth, virtue, valor, strength<br>\nLittle Ones = ṭap̄ = a family, children<br>\n*Simeon and Levi even take slaves as part of the spoil\n\n###Verse 30\nTroubled = ʿāḵar = to roil water, figuratively: to disturb or afflict, stir up trouble<br>\nObnoxious = bā'aš = to smell bad, figuratively: to be offensive morally<br>\nCanaanites = kᵊnaʿănî = zealous<br>\nPerizzites = pᵊrizzî = villager<br>\nFew = maṯ = an adult, by implication: a man, (4th definition has the idea of wickedness) <br>\nNumber = mispār = a number, definite (arithmetical) or indefinite (large, few, even innumerable) abstractly: narration<br>\n*A few things going on here, first note the Jacob speaks up to reprimand his sons. To me this confirms that Jacob believed they were joining with the people of Shechem as much as Shechem and Hamor did. Next, we can note that Jacob is worried that the people will attack him. He specifically names two groups and says that the Israelites are small compared to them. But, if we look at the meanings of the words it looks like Jacob says, he is worried about the zealous villagers because of his wicked group and they will kill him. I think this fear is what finally spurs Jacob at the likely age of 103 to 105 to move on and go to his father Isaac who is still alive at 163 to 165\n\n###Verse 31\n*Simeon and Levi justify their actions by citing what happened to their sister. But let’s break down what happened. Remember, to the people of Shechem he was acting honorably and within the rules of the society. Also remember that circumcision is an outward expression of faith in the covenant with the LORD. We can most closely relate the way they saw circumcision to the way we see baptism today. Hopefully, I do not spark controversy with this but it seems to make the most sense to me. So, imagine this scenario your son gets someone pregnant out of wedlock. Then that woman against your sons wishes goes out and gets an abortion. She just murdered your grandchild. Then she comes to you and your family and says that she wants to marry your son. Your other sons say ok you can marry into our family but first you and your whole family need to be Christian like us. So, bring your family out to the river to baptized and become part of our faith family. Then your other sons proceed to drown each one of them as they come to be baptized. To me this is similar to what happened in the bible passage. Ideally what should have happened is that Jacob should have gone where GOD called him then all of these problems would have been avoided. Once Dinah was raped, I don’t know what the best answer would have been and maybe that is why Jacob remained silent, but it feels to me like Simeon and Levi should have done something different. What are your thoughts?\n\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '35': "###Verse 1\n*Jacob is now afraid for his life because of his sons killing a bunch of people in Shechem. The LORD tells Jacob to go to Bethel (which is where Jacob was supposed to go in the first place). Bethel, remember, means house of God. This is where Jacob originally spoke with the LORD, built an altar, and made an agreement with the LORD. It is south of his current position somewhere a few miles north of Jerusalem. Approximately 5 to 7 miles north of Jerusalem. I mentioned earlier that I thought Bethel may be at the same location of Jerusalem but based on a passage in 1 kings 12:28-29 it is clear that Bethel and Jerusalem are at different locations\n\n###Verse 2\nPut away = sûr = turn off<br>\nAmong = tāveḵ = to sever, bisection, by implication the center<br>\nPurify = ṭāhēr = to be bright, by implication: to be pure, sound, clear, Levitically: uncontaminated, clean, morally: innocent or holy<br>\nChange = ḥālap̄ = to slide by, by implication: hasten away, pass on, spring up, pierce or change<br>\nGarments = śimlâ = a dress, wrapper or mantle (square piece of cloth worn as the outer garment) <br>\n*Jacob, in order to prepare his people to enter into the presence of the LORD, tells them to turn off and sever their connection with their foreign gods. Jacob tells them to hasten away from all things that point to the foreign gods including what they are wearing. Jacob wants his people to be bright, pure and clean before going to the house of God\n\n###Verse 3\nDistress = ṣārâ = tightness, figuratively: trouble, transitively: a female rival<br>\nGone = hālaḵ = to walk<br>\n*Jacob recognizes that the LORD has been with him this whole time. When he first came to Bethel and built an altar, he was there basically making a deal with GOD. Now, Jacob wants to go and build an altar because he trusts GOD and wants to praise him for the goodness and mercy that He has shown to Jacob\n\n###Verse 4\nHid = ṭāman = to hide, conceal especially in earth<br>\nTerebinth tree = 'ēlâ = an oak or other strong tree<br>\n*They take all the idols and jewelry and bury it. From what I can tell there seems to be no special connection with earrings and idol worship so the consensus of most scholars that have discussed this passage is that the earrings were buried because of ether what was depicted on them or because they look like Canaanite earrings that symbolize worship of one idol or another. It is important to note here that earrings in and of themselves are not a problem as long as they do not point to some form of worship of a false god. There is another possible connection with this tree. If we look at Judges chapter 9 it tells of when Abimelech killed his brothers to become king and the people of Shechem crown him king in Judges 9:6 near a specific tree. As the chapter progresses, we see that Abimelech’s surviving brother tells a parable involving the trees and gets the people thinking that Abimelech may not be such a great guy. 3 years later Gaal gets a group of people together to try and take down Abimelech. Abimelech is killed but in Judges 9:37 it mentions the diviners’ tree, which some point to as likely the same tree that Jacob buried all the idols under. So, maybe the people knew the idols were buried there and ether could not or chose not to dig them up but instead used the tree itself as a place of worship and divination, or the people could see a change in the tree that made it special for them. In modern times it has been discovered that gold buried under trees will get absorbed into the tree creating small red spots on the leaves. These spots are gold deposits in the leaves. I could not verify if it is visible to the naked eye but I came across a picture that makes me think that it is visible\n\n###Verse 5\nTerror = ḥitâ = fear [root: to be broken, shattered, dismayed] (only time this word is in the bible<br>\n*The LORD protected Jacob as he left for Bethel with his family. The LORD did so by fear this fear seems to be the fear of being broken or shattered\n\n###Verse 6\n*Jacob gets back to where he started from this is where Jacob first met the LORD and built an alter to him. Previously called “Almond tree” Jacob named it “House of God”\n\n###Verse 7\n*This could be referring to the same alter that Jacob originally built but I think it is a new one and it seems that Jacob now is calling the place “God’s House of God”\n\n###Verse 8\nDeborah = dᵊḇôrâ = bee, Hitchcock: word, thing, a bee<br>\nTerebinth = 'allôn = oak<br>\nAllon Bachuth = 'allôn bāḵûṯ = oak of weeping<br>\n*We don’t really know Deborah’s age however she was the nurse of Rebecca and Rebecca was approximately 17 to 20 years younger than Jacob in order for Deborah to nurse Rebecca then she would have had to be around the same age as Isaac. So, at this point maybe 160 to 165 when she died. She would have been a grandmother figure to Jacob and this is likely the reason why the sadness at her passing. Another thing to note is that the presence of Deborah here suggests that Isaac may be here as well. A popular belief among the rabbi’s is that Rebecca died a few days before Deborah but was not mentioned because Jacob did not make it home in time. There is not really any biblical evidence of this, in fact the bible never mentions the death of Rebekah except to say where she is buried in Genesis 49. Several deaths are mentioned in this chapter so I highly doubt that anyone can say with any confidence that Rebekah died a few days before Deborah and the bible didn’t mention it. There is an account in the book of Jubilees that says Rebekah died at 155, 5 years before Isaac however, this book is clearly Pseudepigrapha and therefore cannot be used as a trusted source. But I will say that the math does add up if Rebekah is 155 when Isaac is 175 (5 years before his death) then that would place her at 20 when she married Isaac (he was 40). The point is nobody knows when Rebekah died so, I don’t see any reason to tie her death to Deborah’s death\n\n###Verse 9\n*God appears to Jacob to bless him\n\n###Verse 10\n*I think this verse is another reason why people say that the man the wrestled Jacob was GOD. Look at what the LORD tells Jacob about his name it is the same thing that the man that wrestled Jacob said\n\n###Verse 11\nBody = ḥālāṣ = the loins<br>\n*The LORD tells Jacob to fill the earth and that nations and kings shall come from Jacob yet another confirmation that the promise is to pass thorough Jacob\n\n###Verse 12\n*Confirmation that this is the land of promise that is passed on to Jacob and his children\n\n###Verse 13\n*The LORD departs so again we see another physical manifestation of the LORD. Is this another place where Jesus appears in the Old Testament?\n\n###Verse 14\nPoured = nāsaḵ = to pour out, especially used for pouring a metal cast, by analogy: to anoint a king<br>\nPillar = maṣṣeḇeṯ = something stationary, monumental stone, stump of a tree<br>\nDrink Offering = neseḵ = drink offering, a cast idol<br>\n*Jacob anoints the alter\n\n###Verse 15\n*Jacob reaffirms the name\n\n###Verse 16\nLittle = kiḇrâ = length, a measure, distance<br>\nEphrath = 'ep̄rāṯ = ash-heap, fruitfulness<br>\nHard = qāšâ = to be dense, tough, severe<br>\n*The distance meant by this word is unknown it is only used 3 times in the bible however because all three times the distance is not very far the conclusion is that it must have been a short distance. We know that Ephrath is Bethlehem. Bethel to Bethlehem is 10 miles so the distance must be less than ten miles, all three times the word is mentioned the exact starting point is unknown however, we do know that it is less than 10 miles. Intrestingly the root word “kᵊḇār” means a great length of time. So, maybe it does point to a relatively long way to go considering that Rachel is having a hard labor? \n\n###Verse 17\n*The midwife is basically telling Rachel that her son will be ok so Rachel doesn’t have to worry about him\n\n###Verse 18\nBen-oni = ben-'ônî = son of my sorrow<br>\nBenjamin = binyāmîn = son of the right hand<br>\n*This is a compound word Ben means son and Oni means to pant, trouble or sorrow. So, she is basically calling him son of my hard labor. But his father names him son of my right hand. Remember the word for right hand could mean right or power or even south so he could simply be saying he is the son that was born down south in Canaan verses all the others born up north in Haran which seems to make the most since to me because he is the youngest. Some people say that if you take the word “binyāmîn” and break it down in a certain way it is close to the word 100. These people go on to use that as evidence that Jacob was 100 years old when Benjamin was born. However, if that were the case then that would mean that Dinah would have been 7 or 8 when she was taken by Shechem and Simeon would have been 12 while Levi was 11 when they killed an entire village and took women and children as slaves along with a whole bunch of stuff. Again, to me this seems very unlikely to be the case, therefore I do not think the tentative connection of Benjamin to 100 is helpful for determining Jacob’s age a Benjamins birth. There is based on the Dinah story I think it is much more accurate to say that Jacob was somewhere between 104 to 107 when Benjamin was born depending on how quickly he left Shechem after the Dinah incident and how long they spent in Bethel with that alter making and the funeral for Deborah before traveling to Bethlehem. This would make Joseph about 12 to 16 when Benjamin was born\n\n###Verse 19\nRachel = rāḥēl = ewe, sheep<br>\nBethlehem = bêṯ leḥem = house of bread<br>\n*Somewhere along the way between Bethel and Bethlehem is where Rachel is buried. In looking at these Hebrew words I thought maybe we should look closely at the word Rachel or “rāḥēl” in Hebrew. Now we already know that el means God so what does “rāḥ” mean? I looked into it and it is not a word found in the bible so I had to search a bit to find it. It turns out that it is a conjunction meaning “go to” or “I’m going”. So, Rachel when broken down means “Go to God” or “I’m going to God”. I thought this was especially interesting when you combine that with the meaning of the entire word “rāḥēl” which means sheep. I think this give new meaning to why we are called sheep by GOD, or why the sheep are separated from the goats. The sheep are going to God\n\n###Verse 20\nGrave = qᵊḇûrâ = sepulcher, grave, burial<br>\nEder = tower of the flock<br>\n*Jacob set up a pillar for Rachel’s grave. Now the question is where is this? There is a site today that is just north of Bethlehem that claims to be the site. However, others argue that it is more north of there. Here is what I have found first of all we know from this section of Genesis that it is somewhere in a 10-mile stretch between Bethel on the north end and Bethlehem on the south end. Next, we can look at 1 Samuel 10:2 we can see here that the place of Rachel’s grave was known at that time and the place was called Zelzah (ṣelṣaḥ). This means “clear shade” or according to Hitchcock “noontide” that is because the word is broken into two root words “ṣēl” which means shade or shadow and “ṣaḥ” which means dazzling, sunny or bright figuratively: evident or clear. So maybe a shadow right in the middle of a bright day? Anyway, nobody knows where this is in fact nobody has found the name Zelzah anywhere but here. However, even though we do not know exactly where Zelzah is we can learn from this text that Rachel’s tomb is found in the territory of Benjamin. Now Benjamin’s territory was quite small on the north side it started near Bethel and on the south it incorporated Jerusalem but just barely. Over four miles south of Jerusalem is Bethlehem in the territory of Judah. So, it is not possible for Rachel’s tomb to be just on the outskirts of Bethlehem. So, the sight that everyone says is the tomb of Rachel is incorrect for sure. The more northern option is a site called “Cobur Bani Israil” or “Qubur Bani Isra'il” it is a ruin a little over 3 miles north of Jerusalem and is in the territory of Benjamin there is evidence that there are Israelite graves in the area but no clear evidence pointing to Rachel. This sight is south of Bethel and north of Bethlehem and is in the territory of Benjamin, so I guess it is possible that this is the place, but looking at the topography of the land “Cobur Bani Israil” feels unlikely to me. It is out of the way to the east by quite a bit and I see no reason why Jacob would have taken that rout. It just feels like we should keep looking. So there is another thing I came across and that is Joshua 18:12-28, here we have a list of the cities of Benjamin since we know that Benjamin is the place where Rachel was buried and it turns out there is a city called Zelah which I thought was pretty close to Zelzah. Remember Zelzah “ṣelṣaḥ” (צֶלְצַח) meaning: bright shadow is only found once in the bible and nobody has found that name anywhere else outside the bible so I thought maybe it is pointing to a grave yard near or in the city of Zelah “ṣēlāʿ” (צֵלָע) meaning: a rib, side or stumbling. The meanings don’t really match but the words are very close. So, I looked closer at this place an found that it is only mentioned one other time in the bible in 2 Samuel 21:14. And in this verse it is another burial site but this time for Saul and Jonathan, both buried in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. It also turns out that some biblical scholars came to the same conclusion and think that Zelzah and Zelah are the same. So, where is this on the map? Nobody knows. However, it turns out that in the Septuagint (Greek bible used by Jesus and the authors of the New Testament) omit Zelah. There is another word in the septuagent that is not translated by Strong in its place. The most common assumption by scholar’s today about this word is that it is a combination word where Zelah (rib, side) and Eleph (thousand) are actually combined to the word Haeleph (ox). The location of Eleph is not known however either. Haeleph has a more certain location and it is just a little west of Jerusalem. If you were to draw a straight line from Bethel to Bethlehem Zelah (Haeleph) is almost on the line. In the territory of Benjamin but near the border a few miles north of Bethlehem. And the fact that there is a known tomb in the area that Saul, his father and his son are buried in makes me think this is a family tomb. And Saul is from the tribe of Benjamin the same person that of Rachel died giving birth to and Saul is king of Israel.  Because this is a very likely place that they would have been when Rachel died and all the other factors, I tend to think that this is the place\n\n###Verse 21\nTower of Edar = miḡdal-ʿēḏer = Tower of the Flock (only time this appears in the bible) <br>\n*Some say this is a specific tower about a mile north of Bethlehem. Others say it is one of many towers along the way that were used as watch towers when you had your sheep in the area\n\n###Verse 22\n*Reuben decides to take Rachel’s maid Bilhah. There are several ideas out there as to why he would do this. The most common is that Reuben was trying to establish himself as head of the household. He would have been around 20 to 22 at this time. In Hebrew culture and several places in the bible God considers someone an adult when they are 20. So maybe this his Reuben’s way of saying I am now head of the household as the first-born son. Another fairly popular idea is that Reuben was trying to humiliate Bilhah so that Jacob with Rachel dead and Bilhah defiled would have no choice but to be with Reuben’s mother Leah. This would place Leah in the position of honor that Reuben would have thought she should have been in this whole time\n\n###Verse 23\nLeah = lē'â = weary, Hitchcock: weary, tired<br>\nReuben = rᵊ'ûḇēn = behold a son, Hitchcock: who sees the son, the vision of the son<br>\nJacob = yaʿăqōḇ = Heel holder or supplanter, Hitchcock: that supplants, undermines, the heel<br>\nSimeon = šimʿôn = heard or hearing, Hitchcock: that hears or obeys, that is heard<br>\nLevi = lēvî = joined to or attached, Hitchcock: associated with him<br>\nJudah = yᵊhûḏâ = praised or celebrated, Hitchcock: the praise of the Lord, confession<br>\nIssachar = yiśśāśḵār = there is recompense or he will bring a reward, Hitchcock: reward, recompense<br>\nZebulun = zᵊḇûlûn = exalted or habitation, Hitchcock: dwelling, habitation<br>\n*The children of Jacob and Leah. In order the names say something like this. Weary, behold a son, that undermines, that hears, joined to, the praise of the Lord, there is recompense and exaltation. It’s interesting that this would say a sentence that somewhat makes since. If we take the adults out and do just the children it would read: Behold a son that hears, joined to the praise of the Lord, there is recompense and exaltation. This to me seems to work even better\n\n###Verse 24\nRachel = rāḥēl = ewe, Hitchcock: sheep<br>\nJoseph = yôsēp̄ = Jehovah has added, let him add, Hitchcock: increase, addition<br>\nBenjamin = binyāmîn = son of the right hand, Hitchcock: son of the right hand<br>\n*Children of Jacob and Rachel. This one would say: Sheep Jehovah has added to the Son of the right hand. That speaks for itself\n\n###Verse 25\nBilhah = bilhâ = troubled, timid, Hitchcock: who is old or confused<br>\nDan = dān = a judge, judge, Hitchcock: Judgement, he that judges<br>\nNaphtali = nap̄tālî = wrestling, my wrestling, Hitchcock: that struggles or fights<br>\n*Children of Rachel’s handmaid Bilhah and Jacob. Troubled judge that struggles? I can’t really make anything of this\n\n###Verse 26\nZilpah = zilpâ = a trickling, to trickle, as myrrh, fragrant dropping, Hitchcock: distillation from the mouth<br>\nGad = gāḏ = troop, Hitchcock: a band, a troop<br>\nAsher = 'āšēr = happy, Hitchcock: happiness<br>\nPadan Aram = padān = field, Hitchcock: cultivated field, table land<br>\n*Children of Leah’s handmaid Zilpah and Jacob. As myrrh a troop of happiness in the cultivated field. For all the kids in order: Behold a son that hears, joined to the praise of the Lord, judge wrestles a troop of happiness, there is recompense and exaltation, Jehovah has added to the Son of the right hand. We know the bible says that faith starts with hearing the word (Romans 10:17) so I see the first part as saying a person hears (creating faith) join the faith then praise the Lord. However, the LORD as judge wrestles against the world a large group of people (a troop) that only care about their own happiness. But because of the faith there is recompose or (forgiveness) which leads to exaltation by the LORD adding to the flock of the Shepherd aka Son on the right hand of the LORD aka Jesus\n\n###Verse 27\n*Jacob finally gets back to his father a little further south of Bethlehem. Isaac is still alive at this point\n\n###Verse 28\n*This is where we see that Isaac lived 180 years. Note at this time Jacob and Esau would be 120 years old. Which means that Joseph would be 29 years old at this time. At this point in time Joseph is sitting in jail the next year Joseph will be 30 and become second in command of Egypt\n\n###Verse 29\n*As far as we know this is the first time that Jacob sees his brother after Esau that he would follow right behind at a slower pace for the children. Joseph was likely around 7 years old at that initial meeting with Esau so that would mean over 20 years later would be how long it took for Jacob to see Esau again\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

Right of the bat we have a problem with Esau’s wives. Genesis 26:34 says that Esau married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittie, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittie. Genesis 28:9 says he took Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, sister of Nebajoth in addition to his other wives. Esau specifically marries her because he sees that his Canaanite wives did not, please his father so he wanted to marry someone from the family. So now we have 1 Judith the daughter of Beeri, 2 Basemath daughter of Elon, 3 Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, 4 Adah the daughter of Elon, Aholibamah daughter of Anah and 6 Basemath daughter of Ishmael. So, the question is how many wives did Esau have? Some say 3 and that there were some copyist errors and that is why they have not only different names but different parentage. I think this is very unlikely but it is a common belief especially among rabbis. Second option take them at face value and say he has six wives. Two sisters from Ishmael and two sisters from Elon, which would also mean he chose to marry a third Canaanite after he decided to marry non-Canaanites because they displease his father. Furthermore, three of the six would have to be barren which is highly unlikely. I don’t really like this answer ether. I think the best solution is that Esau had four wives. First is Judith second is Basemath/Adah. These are the two Canaanites. Third wife is Basemath/Mahalath Ishmael’s daughter. Lastly, he marries the great-granddaughter of Seir as his fourth wife Aholibamah. This would mean that two of his wives shared the same name but were also known by another name that the bible uses to distinguish one from another. Also, for this to work Judith must have been barren which is why she is not mentioned here in the genealogy chapter. And it seems that when Esau decides it is time to move away he will move to the place where one of his wives is from\n\n###Verse 4\nEliphaz = 'ĕlîp̄az = my God is gold, or god of gold<br>\nReuel = rᵊʿû'ēl = friend of God<br>\n*Esau’s child from Basemath/Adah and another from Basemath/Mahalath<br>\n\n###Verse 5\nJeush = yᵊʿîš = assembler, hasty<br>\nJaalam = yaʿlām = concealed, occult<br>\nKorah = qōraḥ = bald, ice<br>\n*Three sons of Aholibamah\n\n###Verse 6\n*In order for Esau to leave the presence of Jacob this had to be after the death of Isaac. From the moment Jacob flees his brother they area never together in Canaan until the death of Isaac. So, the only thing that I can think of to reconcile this verse is to say that Esau decided to live with brother Jacob in Canaan. After a while though they could not live together and Esau moved back down to Seir. It would make since that this would have happened right at the start of the 7 years of famine. I doubt they would have had problems during the seven years of plenty but that would increase livestock for both of them which would make the land not able to support them at the time the famine starts. There are probably other possible explanations but I did not come across any and this one works just fine\n\n###Verse 7\n*It seems there would not have been enough land to support both Isaac’s and Esau’s households\n\n###Verse 8\n*Esau goes to start Edom, which is technically a land named after Esau\n\n###Verse 9\n*Now we get into Esau’s lineage\n\n###Verse 10\n*Reiterated Esau’s first two children\n\n###Verse 11\nTeman = têmān = south<br>\nOmar = 'ômār = speaker, eloquent<br>\nZepho = ṣᵊp̄ô = watch tower<br>\nGatam = gaʿtām = a burnt valley<br>\nKenaz = qᵊnaz = hunter<br>\n*Esau’s grandchildren from his first born. Note: Teman is the first born of the first born of Esau and made one of the chiefs. He is also mentioned in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Obadiah and Habakkuk. He seems to be the face of the Edomites that the prophets use to speak against Edom\n\n###Verse 12\nTimna = timnāʿ = restrained, restraint<br>\nAmalek = ʿămālēq = dweller in the valley<br>\n*For some reason we are given the name of Eliphaz’s concubine and her son but not his wife’s name just her sons in the previous verse. Note: Amalek is the father of the Amalekites who cause trouble for the Israelites later\n\n###Verse 13\nNahath = naḥaṯ = rest, quiet<br>\nZerah = zeraḥ = rising<br>\nShammah = šammâ = astonishment <br>\nMizzah = mizzê = fear, to faint with terror<br>\n*Children of the second born Reuel<br>\n\n###Verse 14\n*Reiteration of sons 3, 4 and 5\n\n###Verse 15\nChief = 'allûp̄ = familiar, friend, gentle, tamed bull, chieftain<br>\n*Seems that all of the grandchildren from Esau’s first-born son become kind leaders Gatam was missing from this verse but he is listed in the next one\n\n###Verse 16\n*Here we see Gatam along with the concubine’s child and Esau’s fifth born child are chief’s as well\n\n###Verse 17\n*Looks like Esau’s grandchildren from his second son were also leaders\n\n###Verse 18\n*The rest of Esau’s grandchildren are chiefs\n\n###Verse 19\n*So, to recap all of Esau’s grandchildren and his youngest son become leaders in Edom\n\n###Verse 20\nSeir = śēʿîr = hairy, shaggy<br>\nHorite = ḥōrî = cave dweller<br>\nLotan = lôṭān = covering<br>\nShobal = šôḇāl = flowing<br>\nZibeon = ṣiḇʿôn = colored<br>\nAnah = ʿănâ = answer<br>\n*Every time we have seen Seir before the name was of a place but now, we see it is a person so the place seems to be named after him. These are sons of Seir\n\n###Verse 21\nDishon = dîšôn = thresher<br>\nEzer = 'ēṣer = treasure<br>\nDishan = dîšān = thresher<br>\n*Looks like seven sons for Seir\n\n###Verse 22\nHori = ḥōrî = cave dweller<br>\nHemam = hêmām = exterminating<br>\n*Here we see that the daughter of Seir is the concubine of Eliphaz which is probably why she is mentioned in verse 12. This means that Esau’s son Eliphaz had the sister of Zibeon as a concubine while Esau married the granddaughter of Zibeon. My best explaination for how this would happen is pretty simple. Remember people back then lived a long time Isaac lived to 180. Seir seems to be from Isaac’s generation so likely lived a long time as well. If he had Zibeon his third son fairly early on in his life then later in his old age could have had a daughter named Timna (likely a half-sister to Zibeon). This would give time for Zibeon to have a sone and granddaughter. That could marry Esau possibly before Timna was even born. Also, these are Seir’s grandchildren from his first born Lotan\n\n###Verse 23\nAlvan = ʿalvān = tall, lofty<br>\nManahath = mānaḥaṯ = rest<br>\nEbal = ʿêḇāl = stone, bare mountain, to be bald, bare<br>\nShepho = šᵊp̄ô = bold, baldness<br>\nOnam = 'ônām = vigorous, strong<br>\n*Seir’s grandchildren from his second son\n\n###Verse 24\nAjah = 'ayyâ = falcon<br>\nAnah = ʿănâ = answer<br>\nWater = yēmîm = a warm spring or mules (meaning uncertain, only time the word appears in the Bible) <br>\n*Seir’s grandchildren from his third son. Apparently Anah found some water or mules?\n\n###Verse 25\nDishon = dîšôn = thresher<br>\nAholibamah = 'āhŏlîḇāmâ = tent of the high place<br>\n*Seir’s grandchildren from his fourth son. Notice in verse 24 Zibeon has a child named Anah\nAnd in this verse Anah is the father of Aholibamath. When we compare this to verse 2, I can see one of two possibilities. First: Ziberon has a brother Anah and a son Anah. Maybe Anah was named after his uncle? Then the brother Anah has a daughter named Aholibamah and the son Anah has as daughter also named Aholibamah. Maybe Aholibamah was named after her first cousin once removed? Evidence supporting this is the fact that the bible points out which Anah (the son) was the one that pastured the donkeys, so that he would be distinguished from his uncle to help prevent confusion between two people with the same name. The second possibility is that the list of Seir’s sons contains sons and grandsons then the Anah listed immediately after Ziberon is the son and this verse lists one son and one daughter. The problem is that this genealogy seems to list first sons of Seir then shows the grandchildren of each son in order. It would be weird to jump to grandchildren here with no distinction however, ben can be used for son or grandson. Evidence for this second argument is that Aholibamah is pointed out as a daughter and usually the girls are left out of the genealogy unless they are important for some reason like she is the wife of Esau. I think ether could work and I go back and forth as to which is more likely correct\n\n###Verse 26\nHemdan = ḥemdān = desire, pleasant<br>\nEshban = 'ešbān = fire of discernment, vigorous<br>\nIthran = yiṯrān = advantage, excellent<br>\nCheran = kᵊrān = lyre<br>\n*Children of Dishon aka grandchildren of Seir from his fifth son\n\n###Verse 27\nBilhan = bilhān = their decrepitude, timid<br>\nZaavan = zaʿăvān = troubled, disquiet<br>\nAkan = ʿăqān = sharp-sighted, to twist, tortuous<br>\n*Grandchildren of Seir from 6th son\n\n###Verse 28\nUz = ʿûṣ = wooded, consultation<br>\nAran = 'ărān = joyous, stridulous<br>\n*And finally, the grandchildren of Seir from his seventh son\n\n###Verse 29\n*Leaders of Seir seem to be his children\n\n###Verse 30\n*Looks like all seven of Seirs sons but not the grandchildren. Seems like leadership in the area is passed on to the grandchildren of Esau Some of which are related to Seir thorough his granddaughter\n\n###Verse 31\nReigned = mālaḵ = to reign, to ascend the throne, to induct into royalty, to take counsel<br>\n*Now it will go through the kings of Edom\n\n###Verse 32\nBela = belaʿ = destruction<br>\nBeor = bᵊʿôr = burning, a lamp<br>\nDinhabah = dinhāḇâ = give thou judgement<br>\n*First king seems to be Bela \n\n###Verse 33\nJobab = yôḇāḇ = a desert, howler<br>\nZerah = zeraḥ = rising<br>\nBozrah = bāṣrâ = sheepfold, fortress<br>\n*We do see the name Zerah in verse 13 and 17 he is the grandson of Esau. This would make king Jobab the grandson of Esau. It is possible that this is the same Zerah but there, but I don’t know for sure. It also seems that this second king is unrelated to the first king \n\n###Verse 34\nHusham = ḥûšām = haste, hastily<br>\nTemanites = têmānî = southward<br>\n*Husham appears with no lineage and the only other Temanite mentioned in the bible is one of Job’s friends. Job and his friend Eliphaz would have died before Abraham was born so there is no way to make a direct connection here\n\n###Verse 35\nHadad = hăḏaḏ = mighty<br>\nBedad = bᵊḏaḏ = solitary, separation<br>\nMidian = miḏyān = strife<br>\nMoab = mô'āḇ = of his father<br>\nAvith = ʿăvîṯ = ruins, ruin<br>\n*In First Kings chapter 11 we see a king of the Edomites named Hadad that gives Solomon some trouble. I think there is a good chance that this is the same Hadad listed here\n\n###Verse 36\nSamlah = śamlâ = garment<br>\nMasrekah = maśrēqâ = vineyard of noble vines<br>\n*Another that comes out of nowhere\n\n###Verse 37\nSaul = šā'ûl = desired, asked<br>\nRehoboth = rᵊḥōḇôṯ = wide places or streets<br>\n*Same\n\n###Verse 38\nBaal-Hanan = baʿal ḥānān = baal is gracious, possessor of grace<br>\nAchbor = ʿaḵbôr = mouse<br>\n*There are a couple of Achbor’s mentioned in 2nd Kings chapter 22 and Jerimiah 26 and 36. However the man in Kings and the son of Achbor in Jerimiah are both Levites that seem faithful to the LORD so this Edomite King’s father can’t be the same person. Otherwise, there are no other connections that I see\n\n###Verse 39\nHadar = hăḏar = honor (only time this name is in the Bible) <br>\nPau = pāʿû = bleating, screaming<br>\nMehetabel = mᵊhêṭaḇ'ēl = favored of God, bettered of God<br>\nMatred = maṭrēḏ = pushing forward, propulsive<br>\nMezahab = mê zāhāḇ = waters of gold<br> \n*Mehetabel is mentioned in Nehamiah chapter 6 possibly the same person but not likely. Mehetabel is listed as the grandparent of Shemaiah. Shemaiah is a secret informant who was hired to be a false prophet, so very unlikely this is the same but it is possible. Everyone else seems to only be mentioned in the Edomite king sections of the bible we have a list here and another list in 1Chronicals. About the Edomites it seems that the line of Kings is not hereditary looking into their culture most historians think that they had some sort of election or appointment system that chose the next king. They were mostly peaceful people but did have some skirmishes with Israel (mostly the Southern kingdom of Judah as they were neighbors). There are even times where the Edomites ally with Israel in a conflict. They lived in a fairly barren land so they survived by mostly copper mining and trade. They were pushed out of their territory by Babylon then lived among the kingdom of Judah during the time of the Persians. The Greek name for these people is Idumean and they continued to live among the Hebrews until about 100 years before Jesus. Around that time, they converted to Judaism and integrated with the Israelites. Some of them like king Herod (an Edomite) were in leadership positions. After Jesus the Edomites mostly became Christian. Interesting thing about the Edomites is before the conversion to Judaism they worshiped a single God that may in fact be YHWH. Historians call the name Qos. However, they name is very well could be used as a title for YHWH rather than its own separate god. It was a single God and the Arabian people assimilated Qos as god of the rainbow. If we go back and look at the blessing of Esau we see that Edomites will be under Israel for a long time but will eventually break free of the yoke. This comes to pass when they join together to become one nation and one of the Edomites becomes a king\n\n###Verse 40\nTimnah = timnāʿ = restrained, restraint<br>\nAlvah = ʿalvâ = evil<br>\nJetheth = yᵊṯēṯ = a nail<br>\n*These are only mentioned here\n\n###Verse 41\nAholibamah = 'āhŏlîḇāmâ = tent of the high place<br>\nElah = 'ēlâ = an oak<br>\nPinon = pînōn = darkness<br>\n*There are other elah’s both locations and people mentioned in the Bible however all the people are clearly Israelites and the location is near philistine territory so very not likely named after this chief of Edom. Otherwise no real connections with these chiefs\n\n###Verse 42\nKenaz = qᵊnaz = Hunter<br>\nTeman = têmān = South<br>\nMibzar = miḇṣār = fortress<br>\n*Chief Teman is the one discussed earlier that is prophied about in Jerimiah 49, Ezekial 25, Amos 1, Obadiah 1 and Habakkuk 3. All the prophets say similar things about Teman and Edom and that is that they will be defeated by the LORD. This may be the same chief listed earlier or more likely a different one with the same name that comes later during the time of these prophets. Kenaz shares a name with some others but I think this one is unrealated and Mibzar is only mentioned 2 times in the bible both in identical lists of the chiefs of Edom\n\n###Verse 43\nMagdiel = maḡdî'ēl = prince of God, preciousness of God<br>\nIram = ʿîrām = belonging to a city, city-wise<br>\n*These are also only listed in this context\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible. English words taken from New King James Version\n",
      '37': "###Verse 1\nStranger = māḡûr = a temporary abode, by extension: a permanent residence<br>\n*So, Jacob lives where Isaac was living\n\n###Verse 2\nReport = dibâ = slander, whispering, defamation<br>\n*Joseph is 17 and tells his father about how Dan (20-21), Naphtali (20), Gad (19-20), and Asher (19) were treating the flock. Benjamin is between 1 to 5 years old; this is based on the youngest Dinah could have been for the oldest end and the oldest Joseph could have been at the death of Rachel for the youngest end\n\n###Verse 3\nBecause = kî = that, for, when<br>\nCoat = kutōneṯ = to cover, a shirt<br>\nColors = pas = the palm (of the hand), sole (of the foot), by implication a long sleeved tunic to the palm of the hand and the sole of the foot<br>\n*So, was Joseph’s coat colorful? Maybe, the Hebrew word here seems just to point to the length of the coat making it more like a long-sleeved trench coat or parka. This word is only found 5 times in the bible. 3 of these are describing Joseph’s coat here in this chapter. While the other 2 are both from 2 Samuel 13 when Tamar was defiled and tore her robes. The color comes from the Septuagint in Greek the word used here is “poikilos” which means motley, various in character, of diverse sorts or various colors. So, this is where the coat of many colors comes from. Unlike “pas”, “poikilos” shows up 21 times in the Old Testament. Clearly, the Hebrew and Greek words used to describe Joseph’s coat do not have the exact same meaning. In fact, if we go to Judges 5:30 where “poikilos” is used in the Septuagint we see the Hebrew word “ṣeḇaʿ” which means to dip or to dye. So, is the coat long-sleeved or multi colored or both? Actually, it doesn’t really matter. The point here is that Joseph was given a garment that set him apart from his brothers. A long-sleeved cloak that went down to his ankles whether colorful or not would have distinguished Joseph as someone of greater importance. Notice also that Joseph is reporting on how his brothers are performing their duties. Taken together it seems that the long sleeve garment would put Joseph in a position where he doesn’t really participate in the manual labor but instead is more of a supervisor or manager. So, all of his older brothers feel that the place they should have been entitled to has been taken\n\n###Verse 4\n*Thus, his brothers didn’t really like Joseph very much\n\n###Verse 5\n*Joseph adds fuel to the fire by telling his brothers about his dream\n\n###Verse 6\n*The dream begins\n\n###Verse 7\nBinding = 'ālam = to tie fast, to be tongue tied, bind<br>\nSheaves = 'ălummâ = something bound, a sheaf (used only twice in the Bible) <br>\n*The LORD is showing Joseph about the future\n\n###Verse 8\n*The brothers feel that Joseph is elevating himself and they seem not too pleased about it\n\n###Verse 9\nMoon = yārēaḥ = the moon<br>\n*Joseph has a second dream. This happens often in the Bible I think this is the LORD’s way of giving confirmation that the dreamer did not have just a random meaningless dream but by showing the same thing in two different ways. The LORD can let us know that the dream is from him. Also, by having two different dreams with similar elements there is much less ambiguity as to the meaning of the dream\n\n###Verse 10\nRebuked = gāʿar = to chide, rebuke<br>\nMother = 'ēm = a mother, in a wide sense (literal and figurative)\n*Even his father doesn’t seem to like the dream very much. Note: Joseph’s mother is dead. The Hebrew word for mother that Jacob uses here can be a literal or figurative mother so Jacob is likely speaking of himself and Leah\n\n###Verse 11\n*The brothers seem to just go deeper and deeper into the spiral of hatred for their brother. However, Jacob gives a second thought to the dream and seems to maybe be more open to looking at this as a prophecy from the LORD\n\n###Verse 12\n*Shechem again, remember this is where Dinah was raped. Simeon and Levi killed all the people of Shechem. Also, Jacob did own land that he purchased in the area. Jacob is living south of Bethlehem in Hebron about 60 miles south of Shechem. That is a long way to go to pasture the flock. Most scholars take this at face value and say 60 miles is not as unheard of when you consider that there was not enough pasture land for Esau and Jacob to live together in Hebron. As Jacob’s flocks grow, he needed to spread out to feed them. Why not go to Shechem a place known for good pasture land, a place owned by Jacob and a place that fairly recently lost the population of people that would be using the area. Also, Dothan the place where Joseph went to find his brother’s after they were not found in Shechem is a little north of Shechem. So, Shechem seems to make since even though it is so far away. There are some that point out that in the Septuagint there is a different spelling for the Shechem here and the Shechem mentioned earlier so it is possible that they are different places but, the vast majority do not hold to this view\n\n###Verse 13\n*Seems like dad is going to send Joseph to check on how his brothers are doing in Shechem\n\n###Verse 14\n*Jacob is sent to check on his brothers and report back to Jacob how they area doing. This is exactly why Joseph’s brothers despise him\n\n###Verse 15\nFound him = māṣā' = to come forth, to appear, transitively: to find or acquire, figuratively: to occur, meet or be present<br>\nSeeking = bāqaš = to search out (specifically in worship or prayer), by implication: to strive after<br>\n*Jacob gets to Shechem and his brothers are nowhere to be found so he starts to look around and a man asks Joseph if he needs any help\n\n###Verse 16\n*Joseph tells the man that he is looking for his bothers\n\n###Verse 17\nDothan = dōṯān = two wells (only mentioned 2 times in the bible) <br>\n*The man tells Joseph that his brothers went to Dothan and Joseph heads that direction. There area a few that think this is more than a man but could be an angel leading Joseph to where he needed to go. The argument for this is as follows. There is no reason for the bible to tell us that Joseph was unable to find his brothers in Shechem so this unnamed man must be here for some other reason. Also, if Joseph could not find his brothers and went home then he would not have been sold and would not be able to later fulfill the purpose of God to save the Israelites from the famine. I don’t agree with this position. First of all, normally when there is divine intervention the bible tells us that it is an angel or God. Why would that be hidden from us here? Second, there is a reason for the bible to tell us about the false start of Joseph. He was sent to Shechem by Jacob so it would be weird if Joseph went to Dothan instead with no explanation. The fact that Joseph sought out help to find his brothers shows that Joseph is faithful and diligent to carry out what his father asked him to do. This shows us reason why his father and later Potiphar and Pharoh would place Joseph in a managerial position. Finally, Dothan is on a trade rout that leads straight to Egypt so to me this section confirms that it is the same Shechem discussed earlier and shows why Joseph would have been taken to Egypt after being sold\n\n###Verse 18\nConspired = nāḵal = to defraud, act treacherously, be crafty, deceitful, knavish<br>\n*The brothers see Joseph coming and decide to stop any further negative reports to their father. They decide to kill him\n\n###Verse 19\nThis = hallāzê = this very (only found twice in the bible) <br>\n____= baʿal = master, a husband, owner, lord<br>\n*The word “baʿal” goes untranslated in this passage the word appears between this and dreamer. So, it could be translated as something like: look the master dreamer (or lord dreamer) is coming. It seems that Joseph’s brothers are engaging in a bit of sarcasm\n\n###Verse 20\nCast = šālaḵ = to throw out, down or away<br>\nPit = bôr = pit, hole, cistern, well<br>\n*They decide to kill him and prove that his dream is not from the LORD\n\n###Verse 21\n*Reuben seems to not be part of the planning because when he hears of it, he tries to persuade them not to kill him themselves\n\n###Verse 22\nShed = šāp̄aḵ = to spill forth, to expend, to sprawl out, pour out<br>\nBlood = dām = blood, by analogy: the juice of a grape, figuratively: bloodshed<br>\n*Reuben says just throw him in the pit but don’t kill him\n\n###Verse 23\nStripped = pāšaṭ = to spread out, make a dash, raid, by analogy: to strip<br>\n*The brothers take his fancy clothes given to him by his father\n\n###Verse 24\nEmpty = rêq = empty, figuratively: worthless\n*They found a pit to throw Joseph into\n\n###Verse 25\nCompany = 'ōrḥâ = a caravan\nIshmaelites = yišmᵊʿē'lî = God will hear, descendant of Ishmael\nGilead = gilʿāḏ = rocky region\nSpices = nᵊḵō'ṯ = a smiting, an aromatic gum (perhaps styrax) (aka a type of frankincense) \nBalm = ṣŏrî = to crack, to leak, distillation\nMyrrh = lōṭ = a gum, sticky, probably ladanum (aka myrrh)\n*Gilead is the place where Laban caught up to Jacob it is just south east of the sea of Galilee. All three of these were used as perfume, medicine and in religious rituals. These were transported in the form of little resin balls that could ether be burned as is or added to oil to dissolve. Looking in to trade routs from the time the only major trade rout that from the north that went to Egypt is a rout that goes from Damascus just north of Gilead, through Dothan, and on to Egypt. Ishmaelites are from descendants of Isaac’s half-brother Ishmael\n\n###Verse 26\nProfit = beṣaʿ = plunder, by extention: gain (usually unjust or made by violence)\nConceal = kāsâ = to plump, fill up the hollows, to cover\n*While Joseph is waiting in the pit where the brothers intend to let him die Judah says if we just kill him and hide it then what do we get out of it? \n\n###Verse 27\n*Judah goes on to say that Joseph is their brother after all so they shouldn’t kill him. Its better to make Joseph a slave. This way we can get some money out of it as well\n\n###Verse 28\nMidianite = miḏyānî = strife<br>\nLifted = māšaḵ = to draw out (used in a very wide variety of applications) <br>\n*Some rabbis use this verse to say that Joseph was not sold by his brothers but was sold by the Midianites. This comes from the reading of 4 Hebrew words. They are “ʿāḇar”, they passed by, “māšaḵ”, they drew, “ʿālâ”, they lifted up, “māḵar”, they sold. The idea is that the way this is written all four actions should apply to the same party because there is no designation that the Midianites passed by then the brothers did the removal from the pit and sold Joseph. The rabbi is arguing that it should read this way, “Then passing by the Midianites pulled Joseph and lifted him out of the pit and sold him to the Ishmaelites”. At first glance it looks like he could be correct. He even has explanations for why Joseph later said the bothers sold him and they did not protest this. However, there is a very simple explanation that solves the problem posed by the rabbi. When you look at the word “ʿāḇar”, they passed by, you can see that there are multiple uses for that word. The word literally means to cross over, but has a wide verity of uses. One of which is to cause to pass over or bring over. Remember in the previous verses we were looking from the brother’s perspective and they say let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. Using this definition for the word the text would read: “They brought over the Midianites, pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites”. This solves the problem of the 4 verbs applying to the same party they all four apply to the brothers. Now there is a second problem and that is, were they Midianites or Ishmaelites? Midianites are descendants from another half-brother of Isaac called Midian. So, were they Midianites or Ishmaelites? The answer is they were both. From what I can see there are two possible explanations of the majority of biblical scholars say that Midianite was a broader term that included a large group of people that included actual Midianites along with other descendants of Abraham like Ishmaelites. The other and less likely is that these particular traders were descended from both Ishmael (born about 180ish years before) and Midian (Born about 160ish years before). I suppose a possible third explanation could be that there was a larger group of Midianites passing by and a small group of Ishmaelites were traveling with them and were the people that Joseph was sold to as the Midianite caravan was going by. Now onto the silver first of all shekels was added the bible just says they received 20 silver. The passage here never specifies a unit of silver so shekels are just assumed. I think it more likely that these are not standardized pieces of silver but rather ingots of silver that were similar to each other but of slightly varying sized and quality. If we assume that the brothers ended up with approximately 20 shekels of silver, then how much was that? I don’t know if you remember from before how we found a very wide range for the value of a shekel of silver. I have come across a reason for why that is. It has to do with the relative value of sliver in ancient times verse today. According to truthsaves.org the value of a shekel in silver today is about 20 dollars by this calculation the bothers would have sold Joseph for about 400 dollars. However, if you look at how much time it took the average worker to earn 20 shekels of silver then compare the value of that today you get a very different number. Also, according to truthsaves.org it would take about 2 months and 20 days for the average person to earn 20 shekels of silver. According to forbs the average American earns 200 dollars per day. So, this means that they would have sold Joseph for about 4000 dollars in relative value. \n\n###Verse 29\nTore = qāraʿ = to rend, tear (used both literally and figuratively) <br>\n*Reuben shows up later after his brothers have left with the plan to pull Joseph out of the pit and save him. However, he is too late\n\n###Verse 30\n*Reuben asks where shall I go? I kind of take this to mean where did you put Joseph? He could be thinking that he may still go and save Joseph if he can find out where they took him. Another thing I came across with this passage is that there is an idea out there, perpetuated by people who want to disprove the Bible, that says, this is actually 2 different stories that have been spliced together. They point out that in one place it looks like Reuben saved Joseph while in another it looks like he was saved from death by Judah. Judah said let’s sell him rather than kill him. They try to say that this is a contradiction and support it by using the rabbi’s argument that we discussed earlier. They say one story has Ruben saying we should not kill Joseph then the Midianites find and sell Joseph before Reuben gets back to him. The other has them wanting to kill Joseph where Judah says let’s sell him instead. It is clear that the story flows as one cohesive story and we already showed that the rabbi’s argument that the Midianites sold Joseph without Reuben or the brothers knowing has very weak support. The only thing new that is brought up for this spliced story argument is that Reuben should not have been surprised to find the pit empty. Since he is a brother, he should have been aware that Judah along with the brothers sold him. A clear answer for that is that Reuben was not with Judah and the other brothers at the time when the Midianites came by. This makes since by the fact that Reuben planned to go back by himself to get Joseph out of the pit. It makes perfect since that Reuben would have left the group after they threw Joseph in the pit then waited for the time when he knew his brothers would be heading home so he could go back to the pit unnoticed by them. There is really no supporting evidence that this is anything but a single cohesive passage about what happened\n\n###Verse 31\nDipped = ṭāḇal = to dip, to immerse<br>\n*We don’t really get to see any verbal answer given to Reuben. Instead, the brothers take action by using the blood of a goat to cover up what they had done to Joseph\n\n###Verse 32\n*The sons pretend to have never seen Joseph and they don’t even say this was Joseph’s. Rather they show the torn coat to Jacob and ask if he recognizes the coat\n\n###Verse 33\nTorn = ṭārap̄ = to pluck off, pull to pieces, to supply food<br>\n*We see another word that means to tear here but this has a little different connotation than what we saw in verse 29. Notice they let Jacob come to his own conclusion about what happened rather than them trying to make up a story\n\n###Verse 34\nSackcloth = śaq = a mesh (allowing liquid to run through), coarse loose cloth, sacking<br>\nWaist = māṯnayim = to be slender, the waist or small of the back<br>\nMourned = 'āḇal = to bewail<br>\n*This is the first time we see the word for sackcloth seems to be similar to a potato sack type of material. We have seen several words for Mourn or sorrow before all seem to be different versions of crying out. Jacob was 108 at the time and Benjamin would have been 1 to 5 years old\n\n###Verse 35\nComfort = nāḥam = to sigh or breathe strongly<br>\nRefused = mā'ēn = to refuse<br>\nGrave = šᵊ'ôl = hades, the world of the dead, underworld<br>\n*This is the first mention of Sheol. Ancient Hebrew belief was that the soul was immortal and that everyone went to this shadowy underground place to wander and exist with the other dead. They believed they would be reunited with their ancestors there. However, this was not a happy place with a reunion celebration it was a dismal existence of forever wandering in the shadows. There was also a belief that the LORD had the power to take you from there to be with Him if he so chose to do so. Later this became the basis for the idea of Abraham’s bosom or heaven. Some groups however like the Sadducees rejected the idea of an afterlife altogether\n\n###Verse 36\nMidianite = mᵊḏānî = strife (different spelling variation on the word Midianite this is the only time this spelling of the word appears in the bible) <br>\nPotiphar = p̄vṭyp̄r = belonging to the sun<br>\nOfficer = sārîs = to castrate, a eunuch, by implication: a valet or minister of state<br>\nPharoh = parʿô = great house<br>\nCaptain = śar = head person<br>\nGuard = ṭabāḥ = a butcher, guardsman (as in executioner) <br>\n*Joseph is sold to Potiphar. So, now the question is, was he a eunuch? He did have a wife and daughter, so how could he be a eunuch. There are 3 major opinions on the subject. The first mostly from rabbis is that Potiphar was a eunuch by choice, meaning desire for the handsome young Joseph. This was the reason Joseph was purchased. However, before Potiphar could act on his desires the angel’s Michael and Gabriel stepped in and made Potiphar a real eunuch so he was unable to harm Joseph. In this scenario Potiphar married and had a daughter out of duty rather than any sort of love or desire.  There is a lot of speculation from these rabbis to come to this conclusion. Second, is that Potiphar was married and had a daughter then later rose to the position of captain of the guard. Part of the Job description was for officials close to the king to show their complete loyalty for the king by being castrated. This also seems suspect to me because usually the only officials that needed to be castrated were those that were placed in charge of the harem. Third and what I think is the correct explanation is that over time there was a change in the meaning of the word “sārîs”. Originally, the word meant head of state or high ranking official. Later the word was applied to high-ranking eunuchs and over time came to mean eunuch as the main definition. During the time when eunuch was the main definition of the word is when rabbis did their word studies and came up with the explanations as to how Potiphar could be a eunuch. Support for this is looking at the root word “śar” also found in this same verse that means head person. So, Potiphar was just that a head person, captain of the guard an official in Pharoh’s court, not a eunuch\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '38': "###Verse 1\nAdullamite = ʿăḏullāmî = justice of the people<br>\nHirah = ḥîrâ = a noble family, liberty, anger<br>\n*Adullam was a town to the west and a little north of Hebron. It seems that Judah move out of the house. He has a friend presumably Judah and his friend are in that area however it is possible they are in another area\n\n###Verse 2\nShua = šôaʿ = wealth (only 2x in the bible both in this chapter) <br>\n*This is the name of Judah’s father-in-law. We never actually get the name of Judah’s wife anywhere. We do know that she is a Canaanite and that they probably lived in Adullam\n\n###Verse 3\nEr = ʿēr = awake, watchful<br>\n*First born son of Judah is Er\n\n###Verse 4\nOnan = 'ônān = strong<br>\n*Second born son of Judah\n\n###Verse 5\nShelah = šēlâ = a petition, request<br>\nChezib = kᵊzîḇ = false, falsified (only time this word is in the Bible) <br>\n*This was a town just outside of Adullam but very close. Maybe they were living there or maybe She was just visiting over there when she had the baby\n\n###Verse 6\nTamar = tāmār = palm tree<br>\n*Er Judah’s first born now has a wife\n\n###Verse 7\n*Apparently the LORD was not happy with Er making Tamar a widow. I looked into what Er did that would make the LORD decide to kill him. It turns out, nobody knows. But there is some speculation. Rabbinic tradition says that Er refused to father a child, some say in a similar manner to the way that his brother did. The two possible reasons given were: 1. that Er did not want to tarnish Tamar’s beauty with pregnancy. Or 2. That Er wanted a Canaanite woman to marry. First of all, there is no evidence claim however, there are reasons why people would jump to these ideas. However, if true then it would make since because his brother will be killed for the same action. I have also come across atheist’s discussing this passage. I think it is more valuable for us to consider their thoughts on the subject. The argument, while more in the form of making fun of the LORD and believers went something like this. Why would the LORD kill Er without telling us why? Examples of, Noah being drunk and naked then cursing his grandchild, Abraham being willing to kill his son, and Lot offering his daughters to a mob then later having children with them, were given. Then the question becomes if the LORD does not kill these people what could Er have possibly done that was worse? And for that matter if Er did to something so bad that death was required, then shouldn’t we know what that is so that we don’t do the same thing? How do we answer that as Christians? My thoughts are this. The LORD is the one who made everything, including the laws that we are all supposed to live by, therefore the LORD is the one who decides what is right and wrong. Furthermore, the LORD is the one who has the authority to determine the proper punishment for any act. The LORD is also the one who can decide if he will give mercy and grace to any individual no matter how severe or minor the crime is in our eyes. Even if one person is punished with death, the price for breaking one iota of the law, while another is given grace for the same thing. Now even though that is the sated argument it seems that the real argument is to take everything that was just said and continue it to another conclusion. The atheist would conclude that a god that would make such arbitrary judgments and not tell people what to expect, cannot exist and should not be worshiped. The best answer to this is that GOD does in fact tell us how to avoid his wrath, rather than looking at how we can follow the law which is what all of the atheist commentators did, we simply look to Jesus and know that we are saved by grace though faith. This does not give us a license to sin, but we can go forward in faith without fear despite our mistakes. This leads to the conclusion that if faith in Jesus is the only thing that saves, then the lack of faith in Jesus is what causes death. So, these are my thoughts on why the LORD would kill Er and Onan. The LORD has a plan and the center of that plan is Jesus. The LORD wants him to be a descendant of Abraham and Judah and David. Er and Onan not were not only disobeying the LORD they were actively standing directly in the way of the LORD’s plan and will. I believe that this is the true reason for their seemingly untimely demise. That is not to say that anyone standing in the way of the LORD’s will, is going to suffer capital punishment. We can simply look to Jonah to see that is not true. But the difference is huge. Er was wicked and standing against the LORD’s plans. Jonah loved the LORD but stood against the LORD’s plans. One dies the other gets a correction strong enough to change his behavior. If you would like to see the discussion for yourself I found it here: https://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/02/gods-fourth-killing-er-was-wicked-in.html. This looks like a blog discussing a book by Steve Wells about all the places where GOD killed someone\n\n###Verse 8\nMarry = yibēm = unknown meaning a word used 3 times in the bible here and in Deuteronomy 25 all three-reference marrying the wife of a deceased brother to give her a child<br>\n*Every biblical scholar that I looked at seemed to think this was normal and most if not all point to Deuteronomy 25 where the law outlines how this type of marriage was supposed to happen. But this left a big question for me that took some time to find the answer to. This is well before the time of Moses it is even before the time when the Israelites were slaves in Egypt for 400 years. So why would we think that Judah would have any concept of Levitical laws? I thought maybe the LORD just told the laws to them but we never see it, or maybe they just innately know the law? Something just isn’t right here. Then I found out in an article called “Levirate marriage throughout the ages” by Jan Tranžík, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and I found the answer. Apparently, this was a common practice in the culture at the time. The Canaanites practiced what is known as “Levirate Marriage” and likely passed it on to the ancient Hebrews that lived among them. This was a little different than the one outlined in the law found in Deuteronomy 25. In most of those ancient cultures of the time the father, in this case Judah, had the choice to assign the wife to a new son of his choice not necessarily the second oldest he could choose any of his sons. In some of the cultures he could even marry her himself. The second option was that he would have to pay the dowry back to her father and she would be returned to live in the father’s house\n\n###Verse 9\n*Problems arise, it seems that Er’s brother Onan does not want to father children with Tamar and takes steps to ensure that she does not get pregnant while pretending to do otherwise\n\n###Verse 10\n*Tamar now has two husbands that were killed by the LORD\n\n###Verse 11\nDaughter in law = kallâ = bride, hence a son’s wife<br>\nWidow = 'almānâ = widow, a desolate place<br>\n*Judah sends Tamar back to stay with her father but he says that she should remain a widow and wait for his third son Shelah to grow up. This leads us to believe that Shelah was still too young to marry and in this culture that would have been about 13 for boys. Now we also get another idea from Judah and it is unclear whether he said this to Tamar or to himself. I tend to think that Judah is speaking to himself in the last part. To me Judah is concerned that his last son might die just like his older boys. I think Judah is linking marriage to Tamar as part of the reason why his sons died and he is reluctant to give Shelah to Tamar because he is worried that when he does then Shelah may die also. This is speculation on my part but it makes since to me\n\n###Verse 12\nComforted = nāḥam = to sigh, breathe strongly, by implication: to be sorry, to pity, to console, to rue, to avenge<br>\nTimnah = timnâ = portion<br>\n*Timnah is a little north of Chezib but still fairly close. Some time goes by and Judah’s wife dies. Judah decides to go see his friend\n\n###Verse 13\nFather-in-law = ḥām = father-in-law (root: to join, a wall) <br>\n*Tamar hears about Judah’s trip\n\n###Verse 14\nWidow’s = 'almānûṯ = widowhood, being a widow<br>\nWrapped = ʿālap̄ = to veil or cover, figuratively: to be languid<br>\n Open place = ʿênayim = double spring, double fountain<br>\n*Enaim is a place where the location is unknown. However, it may also be mentioned in Jos 15:34 as being close to Adullam, so it could be the same place, or it could have a different meaning, see below. We see that enough time passed that Shelah was grown up and should have been married to Tamar but was not. We can also presume that the dowry was not returned so Tamar has been waiting and being a widow not really free to marry anyone else. So, she changes her cloths to disguise herself and waits somewhere along the way that she knows Judah will be going. No one really know what the widow’s clothes looked like except that they were rough and required veiling of the face. It turns out that in the ancient Assyrian culture of the area they had a custom that only married women if high status could wear a veil. In fact, if a prostitute or slave woman was caught wearing a veil, the official punishment was beating her with a rod 50 times and pouring hot pitch on her head. Unless the she was a married temple prostitute then she was to wear a veil. Similarly, if a man failed to report an unveiled married woman, then he would be beaten 50 blows with a rod. Much of the ancient Assyrian culture is similar to the Canaanite culture but I couldn’t find anything about ancient Canaanites on this topic. Not surprising because, other than the bible, there are very few records of the Canaanite people. Anyway, if we make the assumption that Canaanites had similar cultural ideas about veiling then we can apply that to the story here. There is a biblical scholar called Hamilton commenting in the New International Commentary on the Old Testament series. He says that “ʿênayim” may not be a place. This is really a compound word that means two springs well if you look at the single word for spring “ʿayin” you see that it has another meaning, namely an eye. So, “ʿênayim” could mean two eyes rather than two fountains. With this meaning behind the word the idea is that Tamar was opening Judah’s eyes. This taken with the assumption that Canaanite culture would have been similar to Assyrian. Judah would not have ever seen Tamar’s face for years because once married then later wearing the clothes of the widow her face would have always been covered. So, when Judah sees her as a prostitute, his two eyes were open to her, aka “ʿênayim”. The idea here is that Tamar may have actually been unveiled in the face and just wearing a head covering instead. This would fit with the culture that prostitutes were supposed to have an uncovered face and this would be how he knew she was a prostitute. To me this seems unlikely because in the verse the bible specifically states that Tamar coved her face. However, “ʿênayim” meaning opening the eyes may still be applicable in two ways. First, her face may not have remained covered and Judah probably would not have recognized her for the above state reasons. The second way is more figurative. Judah would have had his eyes open to his own shortcoming by not fulfilling his duty to have Shelah marry Tamar.\n\n###Verse 15\nThought = ḥāšaḇ = to weave, to fabricate, to plot or contrive<br>\nHarlot = zānâ = to commit adultery, figuratively: to commit idolatry<br>\nCovered = kāsâ = to plump, fill up the hollows, by implication: to cover<br>\nFace = pānîm = the face<br>\n*Judah sees her and plans to hire her. He does not recognize her\n\n###Verse 16\n*Judah makes a proposition\n\n###Verse 17\nPledge = ʿērāḇôn = a pawn, pledge<br>\n*They agree on a price and it turns out to be a young goat. So, Tamar asks for a pledge from Judah until the goat can be sent to her\n\n###Verse 18\nSignet = ḥôṯām = signature ring<br>\nCord = pāṯîl = twine, cord<br>\nStaff = maṭṭê = a branch<br>\n*Everyone seems to agree that the signet ring and staff were both forms of identification that could be used to identify Judah. There are several different theories on the cord. One is that the cord was also identification by ether pattern of twining or color. Second is that the cord was attached to the signet ring and used to carry the ring as a necklace which may or may not have been identifiable in and of itself. The idea here is that if the cord was broken or cut then the ring may have been stolen but since the cord was uncut then everyone would know that it was freely given. The third theory is that the cord was used for sealing packages with wax and a seal so that if the cord was cut or the wax was broken then anyone would know the package was tampered with. The idea with this theory is that only a person of high wealth and status would have a signet ring, cord and staff all with him at the time he happens to pass by Tamar. Therefore, it would be common for a prostitute to ask for those things so that the man can prove that he is wealthy enough to afford her. Any of these seem plausible to me and I could even see a combination of them being the case as well. Note Tamar does get pregnant with this encounter\n\n###Verse 19\n*The Bible does say that she took off her veil so this may be a point against the idea that Judah did not know what Tamar looked like. However, the passage also says that she covers herself with her widow’s garments. Which could easily mean that she changes one kind of veil for another\n\n###Verse 20\n*Judah’s friend shows up again to help him pay his debt but there is a problem\n\n###Verse 21\nHarlot = qᵊḏēšâ = female devotee, temple prostitute<br>\nOpenly = ʿênayim = two springs {*two eyes or open eyes}<br>\n*Note that harlot here is translated from a different word than “zānâ” which is translated harlot in verse 15. “qᵊḏēšâ” in this verse seems to refer more to a temple prostitute, rather than simple services for hire. I could not find anything on ancient Hebrew or Canaanite customs about temple prostitution. The closest I could find in the area and time period was the custom in Ancient Babylon, which is very disturbing. It turns out that in order to appease their fertility goddess there was a law in Babylon. According to the ancient historian Herodotus, at a certain age every young woman was required to have her first experience with a stranger at the temple and this was to be done before she was allowed to be married. She was forced to go to the temple and wait then she must accept the first man that ask her. He must pay her but he could pay any amount he wanted and she was not allowed to refuse on for her first time. The woman was not allowed to return home until this happened. Once the initial duty was fulfilled then she was free to return home and never had to come back unless she did so by choice for money. Herodotus was particularly appalled by this because he notes that some women were not chosen, because they were less attractive, and these women sometimes had to wait at the temple for 3 to 5 years before they would be chosen and then be able to go home. Obviously, this was not the custom in Canaan. We can simply look to the story of Dinah, Jacob’s daughter to see that she was taken for marriage without going through this process. However, we can also see from this story and how Dinah was taken for marriage, the Canaanite culture must not be too far off from what was happening in Babylon. Secondly, we do know that the people in that area worshiped several idols that involved temple prostitution in one form or another. Learning about these practices made me wonder about child sacrifice. Molech for example was worshiped by sacrificing the first-born child. My own speculation on the subject is that maybe the idea was that these young women would become pregnant though this temple prostitution with a stranger and then not need to worry about providing for the child because they would just sacrifice the child. Connecting further this would be a supply for infant heads to be made into household idols that were common in the Babylon area. To me this idea sheds some light on why the LORD would tell the Israelites not to marry outside the faith so that they are not enticed by idol worship. And it makes things much clearer when the LORD tells the Israelites to wipe out a people so they do not infect Israel with their foreign gods. It is also worth noting that some scholars think that Herodotus and the others that report this are exaggerating the practice\n\n###Verse 22\n*Judah’s friend asks around and finds that there is no temple prostitute in the area, so Hirah was not able to retrieve Judah’s pledge \n\n###Verse 23\nShamed = bûz = disrespect, contempt<br>\n*In Strongs second entry the word “bûz” can be used to mean judgement poured out by GOD. I wonder if Judah is worried about being judged to not pay for services. So, Judah says to just let her keep the pledge. We showed up and tried to pay but couldn’t find her. The unspoken implication in this is that Judah is saying it’s not my fault we couldn’t find and pay her she can take the blame for not being paid. We can infer by the context that Judah seems to think that the signet, cord and staff would be of little monetary value when compared to the value of a goat\n\n###Verse 24\nHarlot = zānâ = to commit adultery, figuratively: to commit idolatry<br>\nHarlotry = zᵊnûnîm = adultery, fornication, figuratively: idolatry<br>\nBurned = śārap̄ = to be set on fire, burn<br>\n*Notice here that there is no association with temple prostitution. They use the more straightforward adultery to describe Tamar’s actions. Little is known about the Egyptian culture in regard to prostitution which is probably more accurate to the way the Canaanite culture. However, there are some documents that talk about adultery. In Egypt it was a criminal offence. One of the records talks about a man named Ubaaner that discovered his wife was unfaithful with some peasant. The peasant was fed to a crocodile and the wife was burned. This can be found by James Bronson Reynolds in the Journal of Criminal Law and criminology Volume 5 Issue 1 Article 4. There are other placed where the punishment for a wife committing adultery is burning. The penalty for the husband committing adultery is monetary. Usually, it is paying back the dowry and the wife is given back to her father’s house. The husband can pardon the wife but if he does then he cannot punish the man ether. If he wants to punish the man (with some form of death) then the wife must be killed also. I think this is important because Tamar was supposed to be married to Shelah. This places Judah in the position of being the man who could be put to death along with Tamar. A couple of other interesting points that show the similarity between Egypt and Babylon with the Canaanite culture. There were laws regarding being married to a temple virgin. Even when married she was to remain a virgin. In this case she was allowed to give her husband her maids and any children by her maids were considered children of the wife. To me this practice seems similar to what Rachel and Leah did. Also, there were laws about rape however, the one unprotected class was the non-betrothed virgin. It seems this woman could not be raped but rather taken as a wife in that circumstance. This sounds very familiar to what happened with Dinah\n\n###Verse 25\nSignet = ḥōṯemeṯ = a seal<br>\n*Tamar uses a slightly different word for seal vs signet ring. But the more important point is that Judah learns why his signet, cord and staff would be more valuable to the prostitute than a goat\n\n###Verse 26\nRighteous = ṣāḏaq = to be right, just, righteous<br>\n*Judah realizes the harm he has caused Tamar and says that she was right. So, did she eventually marry Shelah? We can see from Numbers 26:20 that Shelah, Perez and Zerah were all children of Judah and Shelah had children. The mother of Shelah’s children is not named. However, the implication of the text is that because the children of Tamar are considered to be sons of Judah, that makes her bonded to Judah. If the sons had been named to be of Er or Shelah then that would imply that the marriage to Shelah took place. As is because there is no formal marriage between Judah and Tamar and because he never knew her again, yet the children are his. This basically makes Tamar Judah’s concubine\n\n###Verse 27\n*Tamar has twins\n\n###Verse 28\nScarlet = šānî = an insect (coccus ilicis) that is used to produce red dye, or things that are dyed with the dye, crimson, scarlet<br>\n*I found one person that mentioned that red bracelets were used to mark the first-born child. However, nobody else seems to hold to this idea. I can’t really find any other significance to a red bracelet. So, why did the midwife do this? The best explanation that I have found is that the because an arm came out first then went back in this fact signals a difficult birth in which there is significant threat to the mother’s life. They wanted to mark the first born so that if she dies and they need to remove the children then they will know which is the first born. It is also useful so that the children don’t get mixed up in the commotion and they can be sure they have the correct child as the first born\n\n###Verse 29\nBreak = pāraṣ = to break out <br>\nBreach = pereṣ = a break<br>\nPerez = pereṣ = breach, Hitchcock: divided<br>\n*It turns out that the one that was born first was the baby without the scarlet string. So, the one without the string became the first born\n\n###Verse 30\nZerah = zeraḥ = rising<br>\n*Zerah became the second born of Tamar and Judah. Now we have one further thing to consider, Judah was about 21 when Joseph was sold and he moves into Egypt when he is about 43 or 44. Based on the way the text is written it seems that Judah got married after Joseph was sold but I suppose it is possible that he could have married before Joseph was sold. Assuming it was after if Er is born when Judah is 21 to 22 then Onan at 22 to 23 and Shelah at 23 to 24. This would mean that the earliest marriageable age for Shelah to Tamar would have been 14 years later when Judah was 38. Assuming again 1 to 2 years for Tamar to wait for Judah to allow Shelah to marry her before she takes matters into her own hands. This would make Judah approximately 40 when his Perez and Zerah were born which would make them under 5 when they went into Egypt. There is a lot of assumptions here so these numbers could be wrong but the point is there is plenty of time for this to have taken place\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '39': "###Verse 1\n*We return to Joseph he is sold to Potiphar. First thing to note is the word “p̄vṭyp̄r” is only found twice in the entire Bible, here and right at the end of Genesis 37. There is possibly one other location where the name is mentioned found in Genesis 41:45 but we will get to that later. From here on out Joseph is working for his master and his master’s wife. Pretty much everyone says that this master is Potiphar. However, to me it looks possible that Potiphar bought Joseph and then brought Joseph to his unnamed master. I still think that Joseph was in Potiphar’s house, I just wanted to point out this possibility because Potiphar is never mentioned again … maybe. This brings us back to Genesis 41:45 where the word “pôṭî p̄eraʿ” both this Potipherah and Potiphar mean of the sun or of the sun god and some people believe that these are the same person. If they are then Joseph will eventually marry Potipher’s daughter. More people seem to think these are two different people the biggest reason being that Potiphar is a captain of the guard while Potipherah is a priest of On. After looking into it I think they area different people but these are the ideas out there about this section\n\n###Verse 2\n*The LORD blessed Joseph. He seems to be good at administration.

So, Joseph is managing the food supply similar to what he did before and what he will do in the future. I think that the LORD has blessed Joseph with the innate ability to be a good manager but to me it seems that the LORD has also given Joseph the ability to practice and refine his skill\n\n###Verse 6\nHe left all = ʿāzaḇ = -to loosen, relinquish, permit<br>\nWhat he had = mᵊ'ûmâ = -a speck, a point, by implication: something, with negative: nothing<br>\nHandsome = yāp̄ê = beautiful<br>\nForm= tō'ar = -outline, figure, appearance<br>\nAppearance = mar'ê = a view, sight, the looks<br>\n*Joseph was so trustworthy that the master didn’t even know what he had even down to the smallest speck. Except he knew what he was eating. And we also get a note that Joseph is handsome. We see that the same words used here to describe Joseph were used to describe Rachel\n\n###Verse 7\n*How he looks doesn’t get past Joseph’s master’s wife and she tries to solicit Joseph. The bible is pretty clear here that she is attracted to Joseph’s handsome appearance and this is why she approaches him\n\n###Verse 8\n*Joseph basically refuses her because he does not want to break his master’s trust. He may or may not have been attracted to her, the Bible does not say. The assumption is that Joseph did need to resist temptation and here at least the reason given is about his master’s trust\n\n###Verse 9\n*Here we have the more important reason that Joseph resists the temptation. Joseph recognized this as a sin not only against his master but a sin against the LORD. This is true of all sin. Whenever sin is committed there are always at least two sins being committed. It hasn’t been revealed yet but the greatest commandment is the most important, found in Mark 12:29-30, which basically says to love the LORD. The section then goes on to say in Mark 12:31 that the second most important commandment is to love your neighbor. Therefore, any sin first breaks the command to love the LORD and second breaks the command to love your neighbor. Joseph recognizes this and points out both breaking the trust of his master and missing the mark with the LORD are the reasons that he cannot accept her temptation. This understanding can be useful for us today. Sometimes in our own lives we can justify a sin by saying this is a victimless sin. Because, we convince ourselves that it won’t hurt anyone then it is ok. But we need to remember that the sin will always hurt the LORD. And even though we sometimes justify to ourselves that others do not get hurt, I cannot think of any sin that does not cause harm to another person in some way. Lastly, we hurt ourselves with the sin as well\n\n###Verse 10\nWith her (First time) = 'ēṣel = joining a side, near<br>\nTo be = hāyâ = -to exist, to be, to come to pass<br>\nWith her (Second time) = ʿim = -with, equally with, often with<br>\n*She continues day after day to try and tempt Joseph. I noticed here that the word “hāyâ” is the same word used in Genesis 1 when the LORD created the world. So, it is almost as if she is telling Joseph to create with her. We do not know how easy or difficult it was for Joseph to resist day by day. We do know that the Bible itself talks about the concept of continually bothering someone until they give in to what you want. This is found in Luke 18:1-8\n\n###Verse 11\nWork = mᵊlā'ḵâ = -deputyship, occupation, work, ministry, generally: employment, the result of labor<br>\n*Joseph by my reading is going about his day doing his Job. Note the word work here is the same as the word used when the LORD told Adam and Eve to work the garden and also the same word used in the 10 commandments when it says to do no work on the sabbath. There are other thoughts about this passage from some rabbis. They have some strange and biblically unfounded traditions about this story. Found in the Talmud they say that at this point in the story the “work” Joseph was going in the house to do was to finally give in to the temptation from his master’s wife, who in this tradition is named Zuleikha. The reason she was seeking Joseph is two-fold one he was very good looking and two her husband was castrated by the angel Michael and then emasculated by Gabriel. According to the Aggadic tradition, this was done to protect Joseph in response to Potiphar himself planning to use his slave in a similar way that his wife desires Joseph. Which brings us to the second reason Potiphar’s wife is left unfulfilled by her husband. Then Joseph because he was handsome started to become vain and show off his appearance and somewhat purposefully entice her and that Joseph must have been super human to refuse her the first time. And, according to the Talmud, this time he was coming here with the intention to sin. The story goes that this day was an idolatrous festival and that is why everyone is out of the house. Zuleikha claims to be sick with the plan finally have some alone time with Joseph. Joseph seems to be aware of this and goes into the house to meet her. Clearly, this does not reflect the actual biblical account but I thought it would be good to know what some people believe about this story. I will continue with this story as we progress through this chapter\n\n###Verse 12\nCaught = tāp̄aś = to manipulate, to seize, to capture, wield, figuratively to use unwarrantably {Unwarrantably means: not justifiable, inexcusable, improper}<br>\nGarment = beḡeḏ = -covering, clothing, figuratively: treachery or pillage<br>\nLeft = ʿāzaḇ = -loosen, relinquish, permit<br>\nHand = yāḏ = -a hand, figuratively: power<br>\nOutside = ḥûṣ = -to sever, separate by wall, i.e.: outside, outdoors<br>\n*The only new word here is “tāp̄aś”, but I put these down so we can see this story from another perspective. Literally these words say: “She seized his clothing, said ‘lie with me’, he relinquished them, and ran outside leaving the clothing in her hand.” Now if we look at those same words but use the figurative meaning, we get something like this: “She improperly pillaged him and said ‘lie with me’, Joseph loosened the treachery in her power, by severing himself from her”. To me it is pretty clear that Joseph did not intend to run into his master’s wife and when surprised by her he ran out of the room as quickly as possible. Going back to Talmud traditions Joseph was here with the intention of sinning and when she said lie with me an image of Jacob appeared in the mirror that said that Joseph’s name would be effaced among his brothers calling Joesph the shepherd of prostitutes if he continues with this course that he intends to take. So, what is the Talmud? Well, the Jewish people have the Tenakh which is basically the Old-Testament. The Tenakh is broken into three parts the Torah (first five books) the Neviim (books of the prophets) and Ketuvim (the writings aka everything else that does not fit into the first two). Then they have the Talmud which is teachings of the rabbis to explain the Tenakh. The Talmud was written after the time of Christ and is also broken into two basic parts. The Mishnah which is clarifications on how to follow every law in the Torah, and the Gemara which discussed the Mishnah in further detail and clarifies other teachings in the Torah that need further explanation. Like for example, the details of what happened between Joseph his master and master’s wife\n\n###Verse 13\n*His master’s wife seems to be surprised by the suddenness of Josephs departure again clearly against the Hebrew traditions that we have been discussing. Here the Hebrew tradition departs further from the Bible. It says that this vision that Joseph sees snaps him out of what he was doing and he manages to spill his seed on the ground\n\n###Verse 14\n*She now twists the events of what happened to accuse Joseph of wrong doing. Now the question becomes why it seems to me the most common reason people think of is revenge for being slighted by Joseph. Another more subtle reason is that she is protecting herself. Now that she has this garment if she is caught with it without a good reason for why she has it then she would have been discovered. So, this may be a matter of her trying to protect herself. Which to me seems more likely. Notice that she is also blaming her husband for bring in this Hebrew and placing her in danger. To me also feels like a cover up rather than her taking revenge\n\n###Verse 15\n*She presents her evidence to support her version of events\n\n###Verse 16\n*She keeps a tight hold on the garment to show her husband. It seems that she knows the only way he will turn against Joseph would be if he sees the evidence with his own eyes\n\n###Verse 17\nCame in = bô' = -to go or come, go in, come in<br>\nTo me = 'ēl = -motion toward<br>\n*These are the two words the master’s wife uses to describe what Joseph had done. Pretty much every commentator I could find says that Joseph was accused of attempted rape. However, these are the same two words used to describe how Abraham got Hagar pregnant. Similar words were used to describe Lot and his daughters the to me was to us but otherwise the same. Also, the same to word are used to describe Jacob and both his wives and Bilhah. The same to words are used to talk about Judah and his wife, Tamar and Onan and Tamar and Judah himself with the word for conceived following just the “bô'” “'ēl”. To me it is pretty clear that the master’s wife is not accusing Joseph of attempted rape. I think she is accusing him of rape\n\n###Verse 18\n*She tells her husband the same story about how Joeseph’s garment ended up in her hand\n\n###Verse 19\n*Now let’s look at the master’s reaction. He gets very angry to me is seems pretty clear that he believes what his wife had told him. Probably some of the anger is due to broken trust that he had with Joseph. This is very different than what we see in the Hebrew tradition about the story. That story says that Potiphar did not believe his wife and assumed it was her fault. Then he inspected the garment and found that it was torn in the back not the front so clearly it was taken as Joseph was running away. It seems like Potiphar will not punish Joseph and the wife is now getting ridiculed by all her friends for what she did. Zuleikha then comes up with a plan where she invites all her friends to a party and gives them some oranges to slice then she has Joseph walk through the room. All the women accidently cut their hands because they are distracted by Joseph’s beauty. Zuleikha wins her friends back by saying that she had to deal with someone as handsome as Joseph and how can they blame her if she couldn’t control herself, after this pressure mounted and it became inevitable that Joseph needed to be punished. The punishment for rape was death but according to this tradition Potiphar who is now the priest Potipherah asked Pharo to spare Joseph’s life because he believed Joseph to be innocent. Pharo decided to imprison Joseph rather than execute him and that is how Joseph gets placed in prison. Again, seems pretty different than what we see in the bible. One thing that jumps out at me though is that the punishment for Joseph should have been death. I can think of a couple reasons this did not happen. First normally if a death is to occur then the wife should be put to death also, however I suppose because it is rape and not adultery she may not have to die. Second there really is no proof of what happened just Joesph’s word verses her word. Even though we don’t see this recorded in the bible, one would think that Joseph did tell his side of the story as well. Maybe Joseph’s master had some part of himself that believed Joseph. Or maybe it was an accusation of attempted rape with caries a lighter punishment. We don’t really know for sure why Joseph was not executed other than we know that Joseph was a part of GOD’s plan and GOD still had a purpose for him\n\n###Verse 20\nPrison = sōhar = dungeon, surrounded by walls<br>\nPrisoners were Confined = 'āsar = to yoke or hitch, to fasten, to join in battle, to tie, bind or imprison<br>\n*The master puts him in the king’s prison. There is another thing to note here. Remember Potiphar is captain of the king’s guard in fact the bible implies that Potiphar is Pharo’s chief executioner. Meaning that if Joseph was to be put to death Potiphar may have had to kill Joseph himself. Possibly that alone was reason enough for Potiphar to spare Joseph’s life\n\n###Verse 21\n*The bible makes it clear that Joseph is now handed off to whoever is in charge of the prison, but the LORD continues to bless Jacob by having the head of the prison look favorably upon Joseph. It is hard to estimate the age of Joseph at this point somewhere between 17 and 30 if we split the difference, he would have been about 23 when thrown into prison. Some rabbis use the book of Jasher (an apocryphal book) which states that Joseph was in prison for 12 years. This seems difficult for me because that would mean that Joseph would have been sold into slavery, transported to Egypt, bought by his new master then worked up through the ranks to be so trusted by his master that the master did not know about any thing he owned other than the food on his plate. Then Joseph would have been approached by his master’s wife then falsely accused and placed into prison all within just one year. That seems very unlikely to me. The earliest I would personally place Joseph in prison is when he was about 20 years old\n\n###Verse 22\n*Once again, the LORD is with Joseph and his managerial skills are recognized. Joseph is placed in charge of managing the prison\n\n###Verse 23\n*Again, we have an element of trust here where the keeper of the prison doesn’t even feel the need to watch over even a speck of what Joseph does. Now it is possible that Potiphar himself had something to do with Joseph’s position because he was the captain of the guard for the king. Another thing that’s interesting is that somehow the prison now becomes prosperous\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '40': '###Verse 1\nThe butler = mašqê = -causing to drink, a butler, cup-bearer, by implication: drink, figuratively: well-watered region<br>\nThe baker = \'āp̄â = -to cook, especially to bake<br>\n*The job of the butler/cup-bearer in ancient Egypt was only given to trusted nobles. The butler was with the king at all times and tasted all drinks for signs of poisoning before serving the king and his family and guests. Food was usually also under his charge as well. He would taste for poisoning and make sure that the King his family and guests were well fed. Because the butler was in such close proximity to the king at all times, he was aware of many secrets and conversations that took place in the royal court. This duty to protect the king also often became a physical duty of the butler to protect the king from all forms of assassination. Because the butler knew the royal secrets they were often used as an unofficial advisor to the king. I couldn’t find any information on a royal baker verses a normal baker in ancient Egypt. However, the presumption is that the baker would perform a somewhat similar role in regards to making sure that the food prepared for the King was free of poison and safe for the King and his guests. I think that the baker would not be in as close proximity to the king so may not be using the baker as an unofficial adviser like he would the butler\n\n###Verse 2\nAngry = qāṣap̄ = to crack off, figuratively: to burst out in rage, be wroth<br>\n*For some reason the Pharo becomes angry with two of his officials. Notice these are not just any officials they are the number one head butler and the number one head baker. I find something interesting the LORD is putting Joseph in contact with specific people in Egypt. First his master is the head of all the guards for the Pharo. Now he will be interacting with the head butler and the head baker. All of these very high officials that interact with Pharo directly are the people that the LORD is putting Joseph in contact with.\n\n###Verse 3\nCustody = mišmār = a guard, watch, figuratively: a deposit, abstractly: place of confinement<br>\n*Notice he places these two into the custody of Potiphar. Even though he is not named he is the head guardsman or executioner\n\n###Verse 4\n* So, it is interesting that Potiphar respected Joseph so much that even though Potipher threw him in prison he still allowed Joseph to manage the prison\n\n###Verse 5\nInterpretation = piṯrôn = interpretation<br>\n*They each have a dream in the same night\n\n###Verse 6\nSad = zāʿap̄ = to boil up, figuratively: to be angry, out of humor, vexed, enraged<br>\n*Joseph notices that his two new charges are in distress\n\n###Verse 7\nLook = pānîm = -face<br>\nSad = raʿ = -evil<br>\n*Joseph technically asks them why is your face evil today?\n\n###Verse 8\nInterpreter = pāṯar = to open up, figuratively: interpret<br>\n*It seems that they are distressed because they have no one to interpret their dreams. Notice here that Joseph does not say that he can interpret the dream instead he says that the LORD is in charge of interpreting dreams not some magician that they were wanting to speak with\n\n###Verse 9\nVine = gep̄en = to bend, a vine, especially grape vine<br>\n*The butler starts first\n\n###Verse 10\nBranches = śārîḡ = a tendril, twig, branch<br>\nBudded = pāraḥ = to break forth as a bud, bloom, to spread, to fly, figuratively: to flourish<br>\nBlossoms = nēṣ = a flower (from is brilliance), a hawk (from its flashing speed) <br>\nClusters = \'eškōôl = a bunch of grapes or other fruit<br>\nRipe = bāšal = to boil up, to be done cooking, figuratively: to ripen<br>\nGrapes = ʿēnāḇ = to bear fruit, a grape<br>\n*He seems to have a dream of growth that is directly related to his former job\n\n###Verse 11\nCup = kôs = to hold together, a cup, figuratively: a lot or portion, the word can also be used to mean an unclean bird like an owl<br>\nPressed = śāḥaṭ = to tread out, squeeze<br>\n*The dream ends with the butler giving Pharo a drink from the grapes that grew from 3 branches\n\n###Verse 12\n*Joseph is able to interpret the dream with the LORD. This is why there is no hesitation and Joseph never says I think it means this or that. Joseph begins with a time frame of when the events of the dream will occur namely 3 days from now\n\n###Verse 13\nWithin = ʿôḏ = -iteration, continuance, adverbially: again, repeatedly, still, more<br>\n*Joseph says continue 3 days and then the butler will be restored to his position\n\n###Verse 14\n*Joseph knows that the Butler will be restored to his unofficial adviser status with Pharo. Joseph asks the Butler to use this influence to help Joseph to get out of prison\n\n###Verse 15\n*Here we don’t get a lot of detail but it seems that Joseph tells the butler his story starting with being sold by his brothers. Joseph is doing this to show his innocence and he is hoping the butler will help him out\n\n###Verse 16\nWhite = ḥōrî = white bread (only time this word is in the bible) <br>\nBasket = sal = a willow twig, an Osier, but only woven into a basket<br>\n*The baker must have been nervous about his dream because he waited until the butler got a good interpretation before he asked Joseph about his dream\n\n###Verse 17\n*For his dream he had 3 baskets with food that took effort to prepare for Pharo. However, the birds ate all the food that was on his head\n\n###Verse 18\n*Again, we have 3 days \n\n###Verse 19\nHang = tālâ = to suspend<br>\nTree = ʿēṣ = a tree, wood<br>\n*Looking at some of the uses of this word it can mean tree but it can also mean many things that are made from wood, one of which is gallows. So, this could be a literal tree that will be used or it could be a built structure meant for the purpose of capital punishment. Obviously, the baker is likely unhappy with the negative interpretation for his dream\n\n###Verse 20\n*Birthday in Hebrew is two words combined day and to bear young. Pharo has a celebration feast and pulls both the butler and the baker out of jail\n\n###Verse 21\n*Just as the LORD showed Joseph the butler was restored to his position\n\n###Verse 22\n*Also, as the LORD showed Joseph the baker was hanged. We get no information as to why the butler and baker are thrown in prison. We also get no explanation as to why the baker was executed. Here are my thoughts on the matter. Both are in charge of Pharo’s health and wellbeing by giving him proper food and drink. My guess is that Pharo or someone in his court got sick or maybe someone even died. And Pharo was not sure which of the two caused the problem. I think Pharo likely threw them both in jail until he could have time to figure out what happened and who caused the problem. Once Pharo was confident he knew what happened he restored the innocent man and executed the offender. This makes since to me as a possible explanation as to why Pharo would do this. I think it is valuable to come up with real life explanations that make since for things that happen in the bible. Even if my scenario is untrue it helps to show that the bible is about real events that happened in history\n\n###Verse 23\n*Then we have this final verse that lets us know that the butler forgot about Joseph. We can get a few things from this passage. First it is clear that human nature is very self-focused. It seems hard to imagine that the butler in the moment with Joseph would have said no I won’t tell the Pharo about your situation. Likely the butler had ever intention of helping Joseph out of prison. However, we as humans are so naturally self-focused that once the butler was restored, he didn’t think to go back and even thank the LORD or Joseph let alone help Joseph out. We can also look at this from the LORD’s perspective. While Joseph may feel abandoned in the moment, the LORD is keeping Joseph in prison for a reason. If Joseph were to get out now it seems to me based on what he said Joseph would have gone home. He may not have gone back to his family but he says he comes from the land of the Hebrews and if he was set free from prison and slavery that seems like the place he would have gone to. Had that happened Joseph would have never met Pharo and he and his family would have died in the famine. The LORD knows that Joseph needs to wait until the time is right to place Joseph where he needs to be. We can learn from both of these lessons for our own lives. First, we need to always be mindful of our own selfish human nature and try to combat that at every step of our journey through life. If we instead remember that all we have is from the LORD, it can help us to humble ourselves. Second, we need to remember that the LORD is faithful and knows better than we do when and if he should grant any request of plea from us. We should still continue to ask and pray but we also need to remember that, if things don’t seem to be going the way we think they should, the LORD is in control and He has a much better plan in mind\n\nNote "*" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '41': "###Verse 1\nRiver = yᵊ'ōr = channel, canal, often used to specifically refer to the Nile, sometimes used for the Tigris<br>\n*Two years later, two years from when Joseph interpreted the dream for the butler and the baker and asked the butler if he would help Joseph get out of prison. Pharo himself is now having a dream\n\n###Verse2\nFat = bārî' = fatted, plump<br>\nMedow = 'āḥû = derivation, bulrush, marshy grass, reeds, rushes<br>\n*Pharo sees in his dream seven beautiful fat and happy cows that come up out of the river and eat\n\n###Verse 3\nGaunt = daq = crushed, by implication: small, thin<br>\n*Next seven evil looking thin cows come out of the river and stand next to the fat happy cows\n\n###Verse 4\n*The bad cows eat the good cows then Pharo wakes up\n\n###Verse 5\nHeads of grain = šibōleṯ = a stream(flowing), ear of grain(growing) by analogy a branch<br>\nStalk = qānê = a reed, by resemblance a rod, shaft, tube, stem, beam<br>\n*Seems that “šibōleṯ” is more about the motion of flowing or growing. Pharo has a second dream. In this dream, he looks closer at the seven heads of grain that grow and the grain is also fat and good, like the first seven cows in the previous dream\n\n###Verse 6\nBlighted = šāḏap̄ = to scorch, blight<br>\nEast wind = qāḏîm = the front part, east<br>\n*Next seven more sprout but these are scorched and presumably inedible\n\n###Verse 7\nDevoured = bālaʿ = to make away with (specifically by swallowing), generally: to destroy<br>\n*Just as before, the 7 bad stalks destroy without a trace the 7 good stalks\n\n###Verse 8\nTroubled = pāʿam = to tap, beat regularly, generally: to impel or agitate<br>\nMagicians = ḥarṭōm = horoscopist, engraver, writer<br>\nWise men = ḥāḵām = wise, intelligent, skillful<br>\n*The dreams seem to be nagging at Pharo his is constantly thinking about them so he seeks advise from magicians and wise men. Magicians were priests of Heka one of the idols of Egypt. These priests typically held staffs that ether looked like or were actually live snakes and were shaved bald. Heka was supposed to sustain the world after creation and was able to manipulate reality thorough cosmic forces. These specific priests were dedicated to learning how the world worked and how to manipulate it. They seem like early scientists to me. They may have also looked to the movement of the stars for guidance somewhat like our modern-day astrology. It seems to me that Pharo is calling for one group of people the Magicians who are wise men. Anyway, among all these people Pharo could not find one that was able to interpret the dream\n\n###Verse 9\nFaults = ḥēṭ' = a crime, or its penalty<br>\nPharo having a dream that troubles him and he cannot interpret jogs the butler’s memory about Joseph. When he says I remember my faults it is not super clear what he means. I have always thought it to mean his fault against Joseph for not remembering to help Joseph out of prison. However, now looking at the Hebrew I think the butler is saying that he remembers the punishment of being placed in jail. And his remembering of that time in his life was because of the dream interpretation problem\n\n###Verse 10\n*The butler uses his role as an unofficial adviser to see if he can help Pharo with his problem. He starts by giving Pharo some background information\n\n###Verse 11\n*He tells Pharo that while in prison both he and the baker had dreams\n\n###Verse 12\n*Here is just a little more confirmation that Joseph was still likely working under his same master Potiphar. He tells Pharo that Joseph was able to interpret the two dreams for them\n\n###Verse 13\n*He finishes by telling Pharo that the interpretation was correct. It seems to me like the butler may be somewhat kicking himself that he forgot to help Joseph. However, it seems much more likely that the butler remembered Joesph because that made himself more useful to the Pharo. Probably a little of both, but considering the two years it seems the later that was the major driving factor jogging the butler’s memory\n\n###Verse 14\nShaved = gālaḥ = to be bald<br>\n*I think this is more than just Joesph getting cleaned up before he goes to meet with Pharo. Notice that Joseph shaves his head bald. This is the same as the Magicians we looked at earlier. I think they are dressing Joseph like he is one of those wise men a priest of Heka. Remember Joesph said that the interpretation came from the LORD, but when the Egyptians hear that they would think of their own idols. And the idol called Heka is the one with the power to interpret dreams\n\n###Verse 15\n*Joesph is finally brought before Pharo and Pharo asks if Joseph can interpret his dream\n\n###Verse 16\nIt is not in me = bilʿăḏê = not till, except, without, besides<br>\n*Joesph again makes it clear that the interpretation of the dream is not from him but from the LORD\n\n###Verse 17-24\nV19 Poor = dallâ = something dangling, loose thread of hair, figuratively: indigent<br>\nV19 Gaunt = raq = emaciated, as if flattened out<br>\nV19 Uglyness = rōaʿ = badness, marring, physically or morally<br>\nV23 Withered = ṣānam = to blast or shrink, dry up or harden (only time this word is in the bible) <br>\n*Recap of the two dreams, note here that some different words are used to describe the gaunt cows and one different word for the withered grain\n\n###Verse 25\n*The LORD begins to reveal the meaning of the dreams to Pharo through Joseph\n\n###Verse 26\n*Again, we see a time of when this will occur in this case it is seven years\n\n###Verse 27\n*Followed by another seven years. Side note: “” translated ugly and “” translated blighted only appear 3 times each in the entire bible. All in this chapter “” is found in verses 19, 20 and 27 while “” is found in verses 6, 23, and 27\n\n###Verse 28\n*Joseph again lets Pharo know that it is the LORD that will be doing something and the LORD that has shown Pharo what will be. To me this is also a passive aggressive way of pointing out to Pharo the reason why his magicians (aka priests of Heka) could not interpret the dreams\n\n###Verse 29\nPlenty = śāḇāʿ = copiousness, plenty<br>\n*The first good seven cows and grain represent 7 years of plenty\n\n###Verse 30\nFamine = rāʿāḇ = -hunger<br>\n*Followed by seven years of famine\n\n###Verse 31\n*The seven years of famine will be so bad that nobody even remembers the 7 years of plenty\n\n###Verse 32\nRepeated = šānâ = to fold, duplicate, by implication: to transmute<br>\nTwice = paʿam = a stroke, beat, occurrence, (something to do with keeping time) <br>\nEstablished = kûn = to be erect, to set up, (literal or figurative) <br>\n*Note the dream is giving twice in two similar but different forms. Joseph points out that this means it is a certain thing \n\n###Verse 33\nDiscerning = bîn = to separate, mentally, distinguish, generally: understand<br>\nWise = ḥāḵām = -wise, intelligent, skillful<br>\n*Joesph now gives some advice to Pharo after interpreting the dream. Notice Joseph says to place a wise man in this position. So far, the only wise men that we have been told of are the Magicians (priests of Heka). Remember, Pharo went to them already and they could not interpret the dreams. Notice also that Joseph says to find discerning man aka someone that understands and can provide answers. Whether, this was purposeful or not Joesph has said to Pharo find someone like me to handle this\n\n###Verse 34\nOfficers = pāqîḏ = a superintendent, commissioner, deputy, overseer<br>\nCollect one-fifth = ḥāmaš = tax a fifth (only time this word appears in the Bible) <br>\n*Joesph continues to give advice on how to prepare for the seven years of famine another thing to consider is that you can only eat so much so having extra during the years of plenty is not useful unless you save it for later. Another thing to consider is that only 20% of what is produced in the years of plenty is enough to feed the entire population for one year. That means that those years of plenty were very plentiful indeed\n\n###Verse 35\nGather = qāḇaṣ = to grasp, collect<br>\nStore up = ṣāḇar = a primitive root, to aggregate<br>\nGrain = bar = grain of any kind, even grain standing in the field, by extension: open country<br>\n*Notice Joseph says to gather and store grain. I looked into what kind of grain was grown in ancient Egypt at that time and it turns out that it was mostly a grain call emmer which is today known as farro. There may have also been some false farro (a form of spelt) and spelt grown in the area as well but to me it is very likely that what they stored was farro. Another interesting thing is that this was also the type of grain grown in ancient Israel. Also, some ancient grains have been found that have ben preserved in clay pots for thousands of years then people planted it and it grew. This is where we get einkorn grain from. Note: einkorn was not grown in Egypt in the time of Joseph. Since grain can survive thousands of years when stored properly, it is a good choice for Joesph to use for food storage for a famine\n\n###Verse 36\nReserve = piqqāḏôn = a deposit, store<br>\n*This is how they will survive the famine\n\n###Verse 37\n*Pharo liked what Joseph had to say\n\n###Verse 38\n*Pharo is recognizes that Joseph has the spirit of God with him however Pharo may not understand that it is the spirit of the LORD the one true God\n\n###Verse 39\n*Seems like Pharo wants Joseph for the Job\n\n###Verse 40\nThrone = kissē' = covered, a throne, seat of honor<br>\n*Pharo places Joesph in a familiar position he is second in charge. This is the same position he held in Potiphar’s house and also the same position Joesph held in the prison. Just on a larger scale\n\n###Verse 41\n*Joesph’s position is a much larger scale this time rāḵaḇ\n\n###Verse 42\nSignet ring = ṭabaʿaṯ = a seal, signet, a ring of any kind<br>\nFine Linen = šēš = bleached stuff, white linen or marble<br>\nChain = rāḇîḏ = a collar<br>\n*Pharo gave Joseph the clothing and proper credentials that he would need for his new position. Now there is archeological evidence that Hebrews were once in leadership in Egypt. There were several rings found with the Egyptian word Yakub written on them which is very close to the Hebrew word Yakov aka Jacob. Some believe that these were the rings worn by Joseph and his officials. The vast majority scholars disagree and say that Israelites were never in Egypt and the Bible is wrong on that point. They say that these were sigint rings for a king of a group of people called the Hyksos. They go on to say that the Hyksos were a group Canaanites that ruled a portion of Egypt in the area in the area of the eastern Nile Delta region for a short period of time. The main city they ruled from was Avaris, which right in the north eastern corner of Egypt, east of the Nile and west of the Red Sea. Another city the Hyksos were in charge of was Heliopolis. A couple important points to note about the Hyksos. The Hyksos people did not come with an invading army but instead peacefully settled among the Egyptians. The Hyksos for a time had a king that was considered to have ruled Egypt. That king was called Yaqub-Har and is the one who had the Yakov/Yakub rings. According to the majority of scholars this name may have a semitic origin. After this period the history of the Hyksos becomes pretty unclear including whether they continued to rule or not after that. However, the next leader of the Hyksos possibly lost control of Egypt. The next leader was called Heka-Khawaset. For thee later dates Hyksos control of Egypt is established mostly because Hyksos artifacts were found all over Egypt. Some historians say that the presence of these artifacts could be from trade rather than rule. The Hyksos people followed semitic traditions that were different than what the Egyptians followed. According to Egyptian texts the Hyksos were driven out by Egypt approximately 400 years after they entered Egypt. However, archeology shows no destruction of Hyksos cities and the modern belief is that the Hyksos abandoned the cities rather than being forced out. Now let’s compare with the Bible: Hyksos and Israelites from Canaan. Hyksos and Israelites basically ruled Egypt for a short period of time. Hyksos and Israelites entered Egypt peacefully. Hyksos artifacts found all over Egypt you would expect that from a population of slaves. Hyksos and Israelites followed semitic traditions. The second leader of the Hyksos was named after Heka and in my opinion the Egyptians seem to think that Joesph was getting inspiration from Heka. Finally, when the Hyksos and Israelites do leave Egypt, they quickly abandon the cities that they were living in. It is clear to me that the people known as the Hyksos are in fact the Israelites who were in Egypt for approximately 400 years just like the Bible says. We will talk more about the Hyksos when we get to Exodus. One more thing I came across is that there are many scholars who look at Hyksos rule and say that they did not actually rule Egypt but instead ruled as vassals under the authority of Egypt. I think that one is self-explanatory \n\n###Verse 43\nSecond = mišnê = repetition, duplicate, double, by implication: a second<br>\nChariot = merkāḇâ = chariot<br>\nBow the knee = 'aḇrēḵ = an Egyptian word meaning kneel (only time this word is in the Bible<br>\n*Pharo then has Joseph ride out before the people and he has them all bow to Joseph so there is no question that this former prisoner is now in charge of Egypt\n\n###Verse 44\n*Pharo gives Joseph so much power that no man in all of Egypt is allowed to lift his hand or foot without the consent of Joseph. I take this to mean that Joseph is in charge of all travel and work for the people of Egypt\n\n###Verse 45\nZaphnath-Paaneah = ṣāp̄naṯ paʿnēaḥ = treasury of the glorious rest, Hitchcock: one who discovers hidden things<br>\nAsenath = 'āsnaṯ = belonging to the goddess Neith, Hitchcock: peril, misfortune<br>\nPoti-Pherah = pôṭî p̄eraʿ = he whom Ra gave<br>\nOn = 'ôn = strength or vigour<br>\n*Joesph is given a wife and goes throughout the land. Side note Neith in Egyptian belief was the creator of the universe and is in charge of the cosmos, fate, wisdom, water, rivers, mothers, childbirth, hunting, weaving and war. On is the name of a city also known today as Heliopolis (city of the sun) which leads us back to Ra. On, aka Heliopolis, was the city that held the temple to Ra. Ra was the Egyptian sun idol. According to Egyptian lore he was the son of Neith. They believed that Neith was creator of the universe but Ra was the creator of life. Most forms of life were called by secret names but humans were made from his tears and sweat. The Egyptians even called themselves “cattle of Ra”. This was because human kind rebelled against Ra so he sent Sekhmet to punish the people. Ra is usually depicted as a human with the head of a falcon and the sun on top of his head. A cobra sits atop his head around the sun and is called the eye of Ra this is Sekhmet. Sekhmet, the daughter of Ra, was the one who was sent to punish man. Sekhmet killed and destroyed the rebellious humans. Sekhmet was going to kill everyone because it was too powerful. In order to save humanity Ra took alcohol died it red like blood and poured it out before Sekhmet which formed a giant lake. The serpent drank the false blood and became drunk and was unable to continue killing people. Every day as the sun set Ra would travel into the underworld when there his head was changed from a falcon to a ram. While there, creatures of the underworld specifically Apep a giant serpent that tried to trap Ra in the underworld and stop Ra from rising the next morning. Apep was trapped there because he was previously king of the earth before Ra overthrew Apep and trapped him in the underworld. When Ra traveled with a group of other idols into the underworld. While there Apep with his powerful gaze would overwhelm Ra and his entourage, if not for the eye of Ra, aka Sekhmet Ra would not be able to rise the next morning. This has so many parallels with Christianity. Start with the virgin birth of Ra (Mary and Jesus), other idols were born of a male and female coming together but Ra was from Neith alone as she was the only one and the creator in the beginning. Neith and Ra are both creators that together brought the world and man into existence GOD the Father and Son). Humans rebel and a serpent is sent to destroy man, to me this sounds like Satan’s twisted version of Genesis 3. The people are only finally saved by the blood, in the form of wine, that comes from Ra, again Satan’s twisted version of how we are saved by the blood of Jesus, with allusion to communion. Ra with the head of a ram goes into the underworld and is then rises again. Jesus the lamb dies goes into hell and rises again. Note: in the Egyptian version (aka Satan’s version) Jesus would be defeated by a powerful serpent in the underworld if not for the help of his own serpent, the very one that was sent to kill and destroy. Sound to me like in Satan’s twisted version the one who steals, kills and destroys, is really the hero of the story. Why is this important? I have heard scholars speak about how Jesus is false and he was just copying depictions of deity’s that came before him. This I think can lead people to disbelieve in the saving grace of Jesus. Furthermore, notice where Satan places himself above the head of Jesus and he is called the eye of god. This is a common theme that you will see if you look into symbols of various groups Satan places himself in the place of Jesus and is depicted as the eye of god. We could talk about the pyramid on the back of a dollar bill among other things. Ultimately though, the very fact that Satan used these ideas about the saving blood of Jesus and the death and resurrection shows that Satan really is only able to lie. He cannot create for himself he only has the power to copy the plan that the LORD has made and then try to twist it to deceive us. Which, leads me to the final point of this section because we know the truth (belt) we are armed and able to not be swayed by the lies of Satan\n\n###Verse 46\n*The Bible gives us a marker here we see that Joseph is 30 years old at the time he becomes second in command of Egypt. This means his brothers would be ranged in age from 37 to 31/30 at this point and Jacob would be 121 this would also mean that Isaac had finally passed away just one year earlier. Much longer than when Isaac thought he was going to die and Jacob fled from his brother\n\n###Verse 47\nAbundantly = qōmeṣ = grasp, handful<br>\n*Once again, we see that what the LORD says comes to pass\n\n###Verse 48\n*Joesph is diligent to carry out his plan\n\n###Verse 49\n*The LORD blessed Joseph so much so that he could not count all of the grain that he had gathered. And remember this was only 20% of the grain produced in those seven years. There is speculation by some that the pyramids were built for the purpose of storing grain. Most do not agree with this idea. \n\n###Verse 50\n*Sometime during the seven years of plenty Joseph has two children. So, they must have been born sometime in the 6-year period when Joseph was 31 to 37. This places Jacob at the age of 122 to 128 when his grandchildren are born.\n\n###Verse 51\nManasseh = mᵊnaššê = Causing to forget<br>\nForget = nāšâ = to forget, figuratively: to neglect, causatively: to remit or remove<br>\nToil = ʿāmāl = toil, wearing effort, worry<br>\n*Joseph’s first born is Manasseh and in doing so praises the LORD for helping Joseph to forget the hardships of his past\n\n###Verse 52\nEphraim = 'ep̄rayim = double ash-heap, I shall be doubly fruitful, double fruit<br>\n*Joseph’s second born Ephraim and in doing so he praises the LORD for blessing him with 2 children\n\n###Verse 53\n*Now the good times are finished\n\n###Verse 54\n*The famine and hunger begin, yet because of the LORD there is food in Egypt\n\n###Verse 55\nFamished = rāʿēḇ = to hunger<br>\n*The people seek out Pharo for help and he says Joseph will handle it. Joesph is basically the king but ruling as a vassal of Pharo\n\n###Verse 56\nSold = šāḇar = to deal in grain<br>\n*Worldwide famine but Egypt has food and Joesph begins to sell it\n\n###Verse 57\n*The LORD not only saves Egypt he saves the world\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '42': "###Verse 1\nGrain = šēḇer = Grain<br>\n*Jacob and his family are not spared from the famine and he hears that there is grain in Egypt\n\n###Verse 2\n*Jacob sends his sons to go and get some grain for the family\n\n###Verse 3\n*Ten brothers go that would be all but Benjamen\n\n###Verse 4\nCalamity = 'āsôn = hurt, mischief, evil, harm<br>\nBefall = qārā' = to encounter, whether accidentally or in a hostile manner<br>\n*Then we get the reason why Benjamin is not sent. Jacob is worried about any harm coming to his son. It seems like what happened to Joesph really affected Jacob. This line here also makes me wonder if Jacob has sheltered Benjamin for his whole life not letting him go anywhere or do anything that could potentially be dangerous. This also leads to the idea that the remaining brothers must have to re-live the guilt about what they had done to cause their father to be that way\n\n###Verse 5\n*The brothers leave to buy grain\n\n###Verse 6\nGovernor = šallîṭ = potent, a prince or warrior, having mastery, domineering<br>\n*Joseph is finally reunited his brothers and what happens. 21 years after Joseph’s dream we see that it is fulfilled. Note this was back in Genesis 37:9\n\n###Verse 7\nRoughly = qāšê = Severe, hard<br>\n*Joseph is harsh toward them and in reality, holds the power of life and death over the lives of his brothers. They bowing before him ask to buy grain\n\n###Verse 8\n*The brothers do not recognize Josep. How did Joseph recognize them after 20-21 years when they did not recognize Joseph. We do not get a lot of detail here but we know that Joseph is shaved bald and dressed like an Egyptian speaking in the language of Egypt and in a position that basically makes him the king of Egypt. While the brothers would be speaking Hebrew and probably given their names when they came to buy grain. Joseph has a clear advantage to recognizing them while is would be near impossible for them to recognize Joseph\n\n###Verse 9\nSpies = rāḡal = to walk along, to reconsider, to be a tale-bearer, to lead about<br>\nNakedness = ʿervâ = Nudity, figuratively: disgrace<br>\n*Joseph accuses his brothers of subterfuge. Everyone seems to agree that Joseph did this as a test to see if the brothers have changed. I wonder if there were some true feelings behind this\n\n###Verse 10\n*They protest and say they just want to buy food\n\n###Verse 11\nWe = naḥnû = we<br>\n*They continue to protest their innocence\n\n###Verse 12\n*Joseph presses the issue. I think that this is scary for the brothers. Because Joseph has power over their lives\n\n###Verse 13\n*Joseph learns that he has another brother and that his father is still alive\n\n###Verse 14\n*Joseph continues to accuse them\n\n###Verse 15\nTested = bāḥan = to test, figuratively: to investigate<br>\n*Joseph says that in order to test them they need to bring their other brother back to him. Presumably this is his way of trying to meet Benjamin and at the same time test them to see if they had changed\n\n###Verse 16\n*Joseph says that he will keep the brothers in prison until they send one brother to get Benjamin to prove that they speak true\n\n###Verse 17\n*Joseph throws them all in prison for a few days. Again, all the biblical scholars say that this is part of Joseph testing his brothers to see if they have changed. I also believe that is Joseph’s motivation. However, I think there were several ways that Joseph could have tested them. It seems to me that Joseph chose this method because he wanted them to have a taste of what he went though \n\n###Verse 18\n*Joseph comes back to them after three days. This reminds me of the butler and baker being in prison for 3 days. I wonder if that is a normal length of prison sentence in Egypt while the Pharo figures out what to do with you\n\n###Verse 19\n*Joseph says that because he fears the LORD, he will allow the brothers to leave and take food back home but one brother will stay behind in prison. My thoughts on why Joseph prefaced this with I fear the LORD is that he is telling them look if I keep you all confined here and send one brother to get Benjamin then how will you bring back enough food for your household and they will die. So, Joseph is instead allowing 9 brothers to return with food and just keeping one as collateral\n\n###Verse 20\n* Once they bring Benjamin back with them to prove themselves then Joseph will release the one confined brother\n\n###Verse 21\nGuilty = 'āšēm = guilty, can also be used for presenting a sin offering<br>\n*The brothers discuss among themselves that the reason they have been placed in this tight spot is because they are guilty of placing Joseph in a similar tight spot\n\n###Verse 22\n*Ruben basically says I told you so, you should have listened to me\n\n###Verse 23\nInterpreter = lûṣ = to make mouths, to scoff, to pronounce a foreign language, to interpret, to intercede<br>\n*The brothers spoke this among themselves in Hebrew in front of Joseph but because Joseph spoke through an interpreter, they did not know that Joseph could understand them\n\n###Verse 24\n*Joseph takes Simion as the prisoner, why him? Ruben being the first born would have been the logical choice but I think that because Joseph heard that Ruben stood up for him that he did not want to take Ruben. It seems like Joseph was very moved by learning that Ruben tried to save him. So, Joseph took the second born instead\n\n###Verse 25\n*Joseph not only gave them grain but also gave them extra food for the journey back and also gave them their money back. It seems that the brothers did not know that he gave them their money back\n\n###Verse 26\n*The brothers head out\n\n###Verse 27\nSack = śaq = -a mesh, course loose cloth, a bag or sack<br>\nEncampment = mālôn = a lodgment or encampment<br>\nHis sack = 'amtaḥaṯ = something expansive<br>\n*It is discovered that Joseph did not take the money they brought for payment\n\n###Verse 28\nHeart = lēḇ = -the heart, figuratively: used for feelings, will, and intellect<br>\n*The bothers become very afraid; this is a physical trembling fear. Note we have stated before but when we see the word heart in the bible this is usually referring to the persons will or intellect. Today we would say my brain is failing or I don’t know what to do. When referring to the stomach in the bible it is usually more about how you feel this would be more similar to what we would describe to day as my heart is hurting or I have joy in my heart\n\n###Verse 29\n*They get home and it seems to me they are telling their father but also asking for advice\n\n###Verse 30-34\n*They tell Jacob what happened. Jacob should be 129 at this point as this is the first year of the famine\n\n###Verse 35\nBundle = ṣᵊrôr = a parcel, a package, also a kernel (packaged plant) <br>\n*After telling what happened they pour out their sacks and show their father what was making them tremble with fear. Now they describe a new kind of fear this word is more about a feeling in the pit of your stomach. It seems to me that after telling the story to their father and then letting it have time to sink in. Now there is a growing dread\n\n###Verse 36\nBereaved = šāḵōl = -to miscarry, suffer an abortion, by analogy: to bereave<br>\nNo more = 'în = -to be nothing, to not exist<br>\nAre = hāyâ = -to exist, be or become, come to pass<br>\n*To bereave means to take a love one from someone especially by death. Can also mean to take something valuable or make destitute. Jacob uses some strong language here. He says that Joseph does not exist and Simeon does not exist. It seems that Jacob has no intention of going back and trying to save Simeon. Jacob is considering him already gone. Then he says “All these things are against me.” In the Hebrew that sentence is 3 words “kōl” - all, “hāyâ” - to exist, and “ʿal” – upon. I find it interesting that Jacob uses these words because it points to the idea that Benjamin does exist unlike his two brothers. Jacob seems terrified at the idea of losing Benjamin as well\n\n###Verse 37\n*Ruben who apparently has two sons offers them as assurance that he will protect Benjamin on the trip back to retrieve Simeon. But we know from the above verse that Jacob has already counted Simeon as gone and would not likely place Benjamin in any risk of harm\n\n###Verse 38\nSorrow = yāḡôn = affliction, grief, sorrow<br>\nGrave = šᵊ'ôl = -hades, the world of the dead<br>\n*Sure enough, Jacob counts Simeon as already dead. Remember this is the first year of the famine and Jacob does not know that it will continue for seven years. It seems that Jacob plans to leave Simeon to his fate. I think they are hoping that they have enough food to last until the end of the famine then life can go back to normal, minus Simeon. It seems that what the brothers had done to Joseph really affected Jacob this is an example of how sin affects more than the individual that caused the sin or even the sinner and his victim. There are ripples that spread from sin. I believe this is why we get verses like Deuteronomy 5:9 where the LORD says iniquity of the fathers will be visited upon the children. The bible is clear in many verses like Ezekiel 18:20 or Deuteronomy 24:16, that children are not guilty of the father’s sin. However, the children will suffer because of the father’s sin even if they are not directly affected. In this example Benjamin is not allowed to go out and live a normal life because of the sin of his brothers\n\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible. English words taken from New King James Version\n",
      '43': "###Verse 1\n*The famine continues and is very bad\n\n###Verse 2\n*Jacob and his family run out of food and he tells his sons to go and buy more food from Egypt\n\n###Verse 3\nSolemnly = ʿûḏ = to duplicate or repeat, by implication: to protest, testify, intensively: to encompass, restore<br>\n*To duplicate something puts emphasis on that thing. This is a common thing in the Hebrew language and in fact the LORD himself does the same thing. Remember, Pharo had 2 dreams about the famine. Judah speaks up and says that they must bring Benjamin\n\n###Verse 4\n*The brothers refuse to go without Benjamin\n\n###Verse 5\n*Judah continues by saying if they go without Benjamin then they won’t be able to by grain\n\n###Verse 6\n*Jacob is so upset that he becomes a little irrational, how could he expect his sons to know what would happen\n\n###Verse 7\n*They point this out to Jacob to defend their actions\n\n###Verse 8\n*Judah says to think of the children\n\n###Verse 9\nSurety = ʿāraḇ = to braid, intermix, technically: to traffic, to be security<br>\n*Judah goes a step further to take on the burden of being responsible for Benjamin’s safety. I think that this comes from Judah remembering that over 20 years before it was Judah’s idea to sell Joseph into slavery. This can be found in Genesis 37:26-27. This leads me to a question, was Judah trying to save Joseph from death by selling him? I see two possible motives for Judah to offer himself as the surety for Benjamin. One, he feels guilty for being the one to suggest selling Joseph and wants to make it right by taking responsibility for Benjamin. Two, he is a person who wants to save his brothers from death. In my opinion it is likely both. \n\n###Verse 10\n*This verse seems to come out of nowhere but what Judah is saying here is that they could have gone and bought more grain a second time and been back already. It feels to me like Judah is giving another reason for Jacob to agree to send Benjamin. This seems to add some urgency to the situation. If they should have already gone and returned then that means they have been delaying. Likely in hopes that conditions would improve and there would be no need to return to Egypt. Judah seems to be pointing out that, if they don’ t go soon, then they will run out of food and Benjamin’s life will be forfeit anyway.\n\n###Verse 11\nFruits = zimrâ = pruned, choice fruit (only time this appears in the Bible) <br>\nHoney = dᵊḇaš = to be gummy, honey, syrup<br>\nSpices = nᵊḵō'ṯ = -a smiting, an aromatic gum (perhaps styrax) (aka a type of frankincense) <br>\nMyrrh = lōṭ = -a gum, sticky, probably ladanum (aka myrrh) (appears only twice here and Genesis 37:25) <br>\nPistachio nuts = bāṭnîm = Pistachio nut (only time this appears in the Bible) <br>\nAlmonds = šāqēḏ = the almond<br>\n*Several new words we have seen another word used for almond trees before. Why do they have food if there is a famine? First of all, Pistachios and Almonds grow well in more dry rocky conditions so they would be less affected by the famine (almost certainly caused by drought) than other crops like grain. The word honey is really just a gummy substance and in that time period they used the word to describe what we call honey today but it was also used for what we would call Jam today as well. Specifically, ether jam made from grapes or made from dates. According to the biblical scholars this was likely date jam rather than honey. Dates grow on palm trees again another plant that does well in drought conditions. Looking at the spices again both frankincense and myrrh require low humidity and sandy well drained soil like dates. So, we can learn a few things from this verse. All of the plants that still produce in the area are plants that will be least affected by drought situations. Also, this was not enough food to sustain Jacob and his family plus some scholars point out that they likely would have needed food for their animals as well. Finally, we also see Jacob continues with his old habits. When placing Benjamin into a potentially dangerous situation he tries to appease the other party with gifts. Jacob is hoping this will prevent the Egyptian (Joseph) from harming his son. Jacob used this same tactic with Esau. Another thing to note is that these gifts chosen do not grow well in Egypt so they would be good gifts to give, plus food is always a good gift to give in the midst of a famine because likely this was hard to get at that time\n\n###Verse 12\nOversight = mišgê = an error (only time this word is in the Bible) <br>\n*Jacob is trying to prevent another problem by having them bring double the money so they can give back what was accidentally placed in their bags last time then still have money to buy more. The idea here is that only honest men would bring back the money and let them know that there was a mistake last time. Hopefully, this will convince the Egyptian (Joseph) that they are not spies\n\n###Verse 13\n*Jacob agrees with Judah\n\n###Verse 14\nMercy = raḥam = compassion, by extension: the womb, by implication: a maiden<br>\nBereaved = šāḵōl = -to miscarry, suffer an abortion, by analogy: to bereave<br>\n*The word here translated to mercy is different than previous words we have seen translated to mercy. All 3 we have seen so far are similar and basically men kindness or compassion. This particular word used here has the connotation of the womb or in other words a living child while the word translated bereaved means to miscarry or lose a child. Jacob makes it very clear in this sentence how he is feeling about sending Benjamin with them to Egypt\n\n###Verse 15\n*With the plan in place they bring the needed things to Joseph\n\n###Verse 16\nSlaughter = ṭāḇaḥ = to slaughter<br>\nSlaughter = ṭeḇaḥ = something slaughtered, meat, abstractly: butchery<br>\nNoon = ṣōhar = a light, dual or double light, noon<br>\n*Joseph sees Benjamin. This is important because this is how he knows that his brothers may have changed. He now needs to find out if he can trust them or if they are still the same men that would sell their brother. Joseph makes a feast ready for them\n\n###Verse 17\n*They are brought to Joseph’s house\n\n###Verse 18\n*The brothers who are already nervous about coming here, get taken by the guards. They are very worried that they will be made into slaves\n\n###Verse 19\n*The moment they get to Joseph’s house. Before they even enter, they start speaking to try and improve their situation\n\n###Verse 20\nO = bî = a request<br>\nSir = 'āḏôn = -sovereign controller<br>\n*They start with the same word Jacob used with Esau. They place themselves under the control of Joseph\n\n###Verse 21\n*They decide honesty is the best policy and explain the mistake with the money. Again, at this point they can only assume that the money is the reason they are being taken\n\n###Verse 22\n*They point out their innocence in the mistake\n\n###Verse 23\nTreasure = maṭmôn = a secret storehouse, secreted valuable, buried treasure<br>\n*Joseph’s steward says that whatever money they found in their sack must have been a hidden treasure given them by GOD. At this point the brothers stop talking. I imagine that they are confused by this and at a loss for words. They have no idea why they would be taken to the house of the man who is second to Pharo\n\n###Verse 24\n*Joseph gives them water to wash their feet. The first time we see this is with Abraham washing the feet of angels and one he calls Lord, possibly Jesus in Genesis 18:4. In ancient Egypt they cared about cleanliness and washed as often as they could. The ability to wash often and keep clean was a sign of wealth in ancient Egypt\n\n###Verse 25\n*Once the brothers realize who will be joining them for a meal, they get the gift ready for him\n\n###Verse 26\n*They are subservient and give the present to Joseph\n\n###Verse 27\n*Remember some time has passed since the brothers first came to buy food. The timeline is a little unclear here but it is likely that a year has passed and they are heading into the second year of the famine at this point. So, Joseph asks if Jacob is still alive. Jacob would be 129 to 130 at this point Joseph himself would be 38 or 39 while and has children of his own that are likely 3 to 7 years old\n\n###Verse 28\n*They confirm that Jacob is alive and well\n\n###Verse 29\n*Jacob is now able to see his brother Benjamin up close for the first time in over 20 years which would make Benjamin somewhere between 21 to 27 at this point. The last time he Saw his brother Benjamin was 1 to 5 years old\n\n###Verse 30\nHeart = raḥam = -compassion, by extension: the womb, the bowels, by implication: a maiden<br>\nYearn = kāmar = to intertwine or contract, to shrivel with heat, figuratively: to be deeply affected with passion (love or pity) <br>\nChamber = ḥeḏer = an apartment, chamber, room<br>\n*Looks like they updated the New King James. Here we have another word translated to heart that is more like what we would think of today. In the Old King James this word was translated to bowels. So, update from what I said earlier when reading the Old King James and you see heart, then think head, and if you see stomach or bowels, then think heart. However, if reading a more modern version then you may need to look into the word a little more or judge on context to see what is meant. For example, in the NKJV both verse 42:28 and this verse 43:30 use the word heart in English. However, 42:28 is the intellect or will, while 43:30 is compassion or the emotional center. Joseph is so overwhelmed by emotion that he has to run away to his room to avoid being seen crying\n\n###Verse 31\nRestrained = 'āp̄aq = to contain, abstain<br>\n*Joseph composes himself and is finally able to return and eat a meal with his brothers. I wonder at this point, what are the brothers thinking. The have come off the fear of being imprisoned for stealing money and are brought to see the man who is basically king of Egypt. However, rather than the business relationship of buying grain, Joseph invites him to his house to eat. Imagine if you were starving and traveled all the way to see the vice president of the United States to buy some food that he had stored up. Then he accuses you of being a Russian spy and says I will let you go this time, but when you come back you must bring you family. You buy food and then when you get home you discover that you still have all your money. You run out and need to go back and the moment you get there you are grabbed by the secret service. You try to explain about the money but the agent says that must have been a bank error in your favor. By the way come to the VP’s house for dinner. Oh, and by the way you have been on a long journey so while you are waiting why don’t you go take a shower and freshen up. The VP shows up and starts asking about your extended family and at one point for no reason gets up and rushes out of the room. Then after some length of time the VP returns and says ok let’s eat. Seems like a roller-coaster of emotion to me\n\n###Verse 32\nAbomination = tôʿēḇâ = something disgusting (morally), an abhorrence, especially used for idolatry or an idol<br>\n*So, there are now 3 groups eating. Joseph eats by himself while his brothers eat in one group and the Egyptians eat in another. So, I looked into this and there are several possible reasons why the Egyptians consider Hebrews to be Abominations. It could be related to the fact that the Hebrews are shepherds. Some biblical scholars’ postulate that because sheep herding is a dirty job and the Egyptians are a people that pride themselves on cleanliness then they will not eat with Hebrews. This does not seem likely to me. First of all, the Egyptians did keep farm animals as well themselves plus if that was the reason then the Egyptians should have had no problem eating with Joseph himself. Joseph was not herding sheep and was over the Egyptians that did not want to eat with him. Some have said it has to do with the sheep itself. Remember that Ra gains the head of a sheep when underground. The idea is that the Egyptians view sheep as sacred and it is an abomination to kill sheep so they do not eat with Hebrews for this reason. This seems to work better and these two reasons combined may help explain why the Pharo would later tell him that Egyptians don’t really like Shepards. However, this to me still does not answer why they would not eat with Joseph. Joseph has lived in Egypt and ate Egyptian food for the last 20 years. I did look into Egyptian farming and animals; it turns out that they did have some area that raised sheep and ate them but it was a small segment of the population and this may have been early on before they developed their ideas about the sacredness of certain animals. They did also believe cats were sacred and at a certain point made it a crime to kill a cat. Also, there are reports of Egyptians shutting down temple sacrifice of Hebrew people because they did not like that sheep were being sacrificed. This was later closer to the time of Jesus. Looking more into Egyptian culture and relations with foreigners I discovered that Egyptians look at Foreigners in one of two very different ways. They start out by treating foreigners the same as native Egyptians. They have no negative feelings toward them at all and assume that they are Egyptians. This means however, that they are fully Egyptian. They integrate into Egyptian society including deity worship. Then Egyptians have a second category of foreigners. These are the people that do not conform to Egyptian society and especially Egyptian worship. Egyptians look at this second group as if they are not even human. In fact, the word that they use for Human is the same word they use for Egyptian. So, in the eyes of the Egyptian the foreigners are either human or not human. This to me answers the question of why the Egyptians would feel it is an abomination to eat with their superior namely Joseph.\n\n###Veres 33\nAstonishment = tāmah = to be in consternation, to be astounded or dumbfounded<br>\n*I see three reasons for astonishment here. The first, and in my opinion most likely, reason is what we had just discussed. Whatever is going through their head, it was very unlikely that they thought Joseph was going to feed them a nice meal at this point. Second, could be the fact that they were seated in birth order. How would some Egyptian know their birth order. Well, they did discuss their family with Joseph and part of that discussion involved the fact that they had a younger brother. So, birth order was at least partially discussed and because we do not get all the details, we can assume it reasonable that they did discuss birth order with Joseph at some point. The last reason will be discussed in the next verse\n\n###Verse 34\nServings = maśśᵊ'ēṯ = a raising (of hands in prayer, of flame, a beacon), figuratively: an utterance, a present, a mess, a tribute<br>\nMerry = šāḵar = to become tipsy, to satiate with stimulating drink, figuratively: influence<br>\n*Once the food and drink are served, they seem to relax. Notice that the drink they server contains alcohol and they drink enough to start feeling the effects of it. Continuing from the previous verse the third reason is that Benjamin was given 5 times the food as everyone else. It could also be some combination of the three that caused the brothers to be astonished \n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '44': '###Verse 1\n*It seems that Joseph does not yet trust his brothers he has another test for them.\n\n###Verse 2\nCup = gāḇîaʿ = to be convex, goblet, bowl, the cup of a flower<br>\n*Joseph’s final test is to have his silver cup placed into Benjamin’s sack. In ancient Egypt silver was valued more highly than gold. And the word used for money, to buy grain and such, is “kesep̄”. This is a word that simply means silver. According to some scholars this cup or bowl would have been identifiable because it was a special kind of cup only used by those who were considered to see into the future. Joseph as one of those would have been given one of these cups. This cup would have been one that only he could drink out of and therefore would have been identifiable as Joseph’s cup.\n\n###Verse 3\nDawned = \'ôr = -to be luminous<br>\n*The brothers are sent out at first light. Notice they are sent away. I think this is Joseph’s way of making sure the money and cup are not discovered. If the brothers had found the cup before they left then they may have tried to give it back early and prevented Joseph from carrying out his plan. Another thing Jospeh has going for him is that the brothers may have had a little too much to drink the night before so they were likely not on their A game this next morning at first light.\n\n###Verse 4\nRepaid = šālam = to be safe, figuratively: completed, sound, by implication: to be friendly, by extension: to reciprocate<br>\n*The word translated repaid is very similar to the word for peace. Joseph tells his servant to execute his plan and what to say.\n\n###Verse 5\nDivination = nāḥaš = -to hiss, whisper a magic spell, to prognosticate (predict the future) <br>\n*Looking into ancient Egyptian practices one thing they did to predict the future was to use water in a bowl. They would take water and ether throw objects in to read the ripples or sound or more commonly they would drop oil onto the water to see what shapes or letters would form and use that to answer questions about the future. This practice was not confined to Egypt many cultures in the ancient world did this, including Hebrews. In fact, there are records of Jews using the oil and water method to divine the future in roman times. The question then becomes, did Joseph actually practice divination in this manner? From all the scholars I looked at, it seems that nobody knows. Some say that if Joseph did use it then maybe GOD used that method to show Joseph the future. Others say that they think Joseph was given the cup because of his status as a diviner because he correctly predicted the future using dreams. In this case Joseph would have kept the cup merely as a reminder, to others, of his status. Speaking of dreams, I also discover that ancient Egyptians also highly regarded dream interpretation as being a very reliable method of knowing the future. One interesting fact about this is that dream divination in ancient Egypt started around 1921BC. This is important because it lines up with the Hyksos timeline, 1920BC (ish) to 1520BC (ish) is 400 (ish) years. If the first time Egypt started divining dreams was around the time when Joseph was in Egypt then maybe Joseph himself started the trend. In my opinion, the fact that Hebrews did use the oil and water divination, makes me think that Joseph probably did used the cup for divination. Maybe they used it because of Joseph. Also, The LORD specifically said not to do that when the law was given later, which makes me think that they were practicing divination and that is why the LORD said not to.\n\n###Verse 6\n*The servant carries out Joseph’s plan.\n\n###Verse 7\n*Again, the brothers are put in a position where they are in fear of losing their freedom.\n\n###Verse 8\n*The brothers argue well by pointing out that they brought back money that was mistakenly in their sacks from last time. They are basically pointing out that they have integrity so why would they be suspected of stealing anything.\n\n###Verse 9\n*The brothers are so confident in their innocence that they speak in haste. They say if you find the cup then whoever has it go ahead and kill him. And the rest of us will be your salves.\n\n###Verse 10\n*Notice the guard says he will do according to their words but he changes what they said to something milder. The guard says he will take the culprit only as a slave rather than kill the culprit and take the rest as slaves. It is not explicitly said, but it seems pretty clear that these were Joseph’s instructions. The Guard likely just played off of what the brothers said to make them feel like it was their idea.\n\n###Verse 11\n*The brothers hurry to show their innocence. Again, they seem confident that nothing will go wrong.\n\n###Verse 12\n*In an instant everything changed\n\n###Verse 13\nLoaded = ʿāmas = to load, impose a burden<br>\n*It doesn’t say here but, because each man has to load up and return to the city, the implication is that Benjamin was taken into custody and the brothers have to reload their donkey’s before they are able to follow.\n\n###Verse14\n*They must have rushed back quickly because Joseph was still home. Joseph was likely waiting to see if they would come as well.\n\n###Verse 15\n*Joseph claims to practice divination, this is the point where most scholars argue that Joseph didn’t actually practice divination but used this as a cover for his knowledge that Benjamin had the cup. We discussed earlier but I lean toward that Joseph did try to practice divination. However, it is clear that Joseph did not try to divine anything from anything or anyone other than the LORD.\n\n###Verse 16\n*Judah goes before Joseph and begins by saying “GOD has found out the iniquity of your servants”. Judah is accepting the guilt of an action that he knows they are innocent of. This is different than before. Rather than trying to argue and protest they just accept the undeserved guilt. This is how to be like Christ, he accepted the guilt for sin that he did not commit. Judah and the brothers present themselves as slaves to Joseph. Remember they said that if the cup was found then they would all be his slaves.\n\n###Verse 17\n*They get Joseph to say that he will not take all of them as slaves just Benjamin. And this is the final test. Last time they sold Joseph into slavery and left to live with their father. Joseph gives them the perfect opportunity to do the same thing again.\n\n###Verse 18\n*Judah asks to speak with Joseph. Judah seems very concerned that he will make Joseph angry but remember Judah told his father that he will be the surety that Benjamin will come home.\n\n###Verse 19\n*Judah starts by trying to appeal to the Human side of Joseph. \n\n###Verse 20\n*Judah brings to Joseph’s attention that Benjamin is the only one Jacob has left from that part of his family.\n\n###Verse 21\n*Judah also reminds Joseph that Benjamin wouldn’t have even been here except for the fact that Joseph told them to bring him last time.\n\n###Verse 22\n*Judah also reminds Joseph that they told him they did not want to bring Benjamin because if something happens to him, then their father would die of heartbreak.\n\n###Verse 23\n*Judah reiterates that Joseph forced the issue of bringing Benjamin\n\n###Verse 24-29\n*Judah recounts the conversation with Jacob to Joseph.\n\n###Verse 30\n*Judah hammers home the point that Jacob will literally die if they come home without Benjamin, because he is already wounded by the loss of Joseph.\n\n###Verse 31\n*The unspoken implication here is that Judah is asking Joseph a question. Will you kill our father?\n\n###Verse 32\n*After all this setup Judah finally gets to the point. \n\n###Verse 33-34\n*Judah not only asks to take Benjamin’s place he begs and pleads with Joseph to do so. \n\nNote "*" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

      '45': '###Verse 1\n*Joseph can’t handle the emotion and clears the room\n\n###Verse 2\nWept = bᵊḵî = a weeping, by analogy: a dripping<br>\n*Joseph was unable to hide his emotions this time\n\n###Verse 3\nDismayed = bāhal = to tremble inwardly, to be alarmed or agitated, by implication: to hasten anxiously<br>\n*Joseph finally breaks character and asks the bothers if his father still lives. Remember the brothers just gave an appeal to Joseph about their father and how Joseph will kill him if he keeps Benjamin. Then Joseph bursts into tears and clears the room. Then when Joseph is able to speak to them again, he asks about his own father and the brothers are speechless. In my mind they have no idea what to think about this situation. On the other hand, it seems that Joseph does not believe his brothers about Jacob being alive. He seems to think this may be a ploy to get Joseph to release Benjamin. This just reinforces the idea that Joseph doesn’t trust his brothers, and really is testing them.\n\n###Verse 4\n*Joseph now reveals himself to his brothers.\n\n###Verse 5\nPreserve life = miḥyâ = preservation of life, sustenance, the live flesh, the quick<br>\n*Joseph has a good attitude about the situation and tells his brothers not to regret their action because GOD has taken what they intended for evil and made it into good. \n\n###Verse 6\nPlowing = ḥārîš = ploughing or the season for ploughing<br>\n*Here is where we get another time stamp. This verse shows that likely the first visit from the brothers was in the first year of the famine. Jacob was thinking next year would be back to normal so he thought there would be no need to return to Egypt to buy food. Therefore, Simion was no more, because, Jacob would not risk Benjamin for Simion. Now we are in the second year with famine so they had to go back to buy more grain. This makes Joseph 39 and Jacob 130. Joseph also warns them that there will be another 5 years of famine to look forward to.\n\n###Verse 7\nPosterity = šᵊ\'ērîṯ = a remainder, residual, a portion<br>\n*This is where Joseph reveals what I call the A-ha moment for the brothers. It is the point that happens when you suddenly see GOD’s plan. There may have been struggles and hardship in your life but the point where you can look back and see that the LORD used those struggles and hardships to bring you to where you are now. And realizing without those then this grand design of the LORD would have never come to be. \n\n###Verse 8\n*To me this is an interesting concept. Joseph says that the brothers did not send Joseph away but rather the LORD did. I could be wrong here, but to me Joseph is basically saying, don’t feel guilty for your evil actions because even that will take away from glory that is due to the LORD for enacting his plan. If I am correct, then it leads to the idea that sin is not only forgiven but forgotten. Because when the LORD makes these things work together for good then remembering the sin would mean you get some of the credit for the good that the LORD has done. The concept of forgive and forget is supported by verses like Hebrews 8:12 or Isaiah 43:25. Specifically, Isaiah 43:25, seems to support the additional concept, of the reason why GOD would forget, that I believe Joseph is trying to point out here. Another note here is the word “māšal” used here meaning to rule was last used in Genesis 37:8. This is the place where Joseph’s brothers hated Joseph for his dreams and said “shall you indeed have dominion (“māšal”) over us?” I find it interesting that now that same word is used here. It is another confirmation of the fulfillment of the LORD’s revelation to Joseph through his dreams.\n\n###Verse 9\n*Joseph tells them to bring his father here to wait out the next seven years of famine\n\n###Verse 10\nGoshen = gōšen = drawing near<br>\n*There is some debate as to the actual meaning and location of “Land of Goshen” among scholars. However, all of them place it in generally the same area, near the Nile River delta and the red sea. Going back to Genesis 41:45 remember the city “On” is a place and is more commonly known today as Heliopolis. Turns out this city, where Jospeh likely is living, is right next to that same place where Goshen is supposed to be. Also, this land of Goshen is the same area occupied by the Hyksos. A couple of interesting things about the Hyksos is that the capital they controlled was Avaris right smack in the middle of Goshen. Second it is pretty clear that the Hyksos also controlled Heliopolis as well. Some of the scholars that acknowledge that Joseph was in Egypt believe that the “Pharo” Joseph was under was really a Hyksos king. In my opinion it is not a stretch that Joseph himself is the Hyksos king under Pharo.\n\n###Verse 11\nProvide = kûl = to keep in, to measure, figuratively: to maintain<br>\n*Joseph will be able to fulfill the will of the LORD by providing for his family for the next 5 years\n\n###Verse 12\n*This line is a little weird to me. I think what Joseph is saying here is that the words are coming from Joseph second in command of Egypt himself, not some messenger. Therefore, you can trust what I say here. \n\n###Verse 13\nGlory = kāḇôḏ = -weight, splendor, copiousness<br>\n*Joseph is saying that he has weight here and can protect and provide for his family here so they need to bring Jacob here.\n\n###Verse 14\n*Joseph and Benjamin have a moment.\n\n###Verse 15\n*He is not having a moment with just Benjamin but his other brothers as well.\n\n###Verse 16\n*Pharo hears about it and is happy to meet Joseph’s family.\n\n###Verse 17\nLoad = ṭāʿan = to load a beast (only time this word is in the bible) <br>\n*They are given provisions for the journey.\n\n###Verse 18\nBest = ṭûḇ = good, goodness, beauty, gladness, welfare<br>\nFat = ḥēleḇ = to be fat, the richest or choicest part<br>\n*Pharo himself says that he wants to give Joseph’s family the richest part of the land part of the land. In Egypt this is the Nile River Delta, the same place the Hyksos ruled.\n\n###Verse 19\nCarts = ʿăḡālâ = something revolving, a wheeled vehicle<br>\n*They are also given wagons for the Journey to carry back the children and the old man more easily.\n\n###Verse 20\nConcerned = ḥûs = to cover, to look on with compassion<br>\n*Pharo further says not to worry about bringing back their belongings with them. They are welcome to anything they need here in Egypt. \n\n###Verse 21\n*Joseph does all that Pharo commands. We see here that Joseph is not in charge and even though nobody in Egypt can raise a hand or lift a foot without Joseph, Pharo still gives commands to Joseph. \n\n###Verse 22\nChanges = ḥălîp̄â = Alteration<br>\n*Joseph gives gifts to his brothers.\n\n###Verse 23\n*Joseph also gives some gifts for his father as well. \n\n###Verse 24\nTroubled = rāḡaz = to quiver, be agitated, be excited<br>\n*Joseph tries to give them as pleasant a journey as possible so they can avoid trouble.\n\n###Verse 25\n*They go back to bring the joyous news to their father\n\n###Verse 26\nHeart = lēḇ = -the heart, figuratively: used for feelings, will, and intellect<br>\nStill = pûḡ = to be sluggish<br>\n*There is that same word again “māšal” this time translated governor, again it means to rule and is the same word the brothers used when sarcastically speaking about Joseph’s dreams. Now in the past when I read this, I always assumed that Joseph almost had a heart attack. He is 130 years old after all. However, Now looking at the Hebrew, it seems more like saying Jacob could not comprehend what they were saying. Jacob is dumbfounded, he is having a hard time taking in that Joseph, his dead son, was discovered alive 22 years later. And this makes more since why it next says that Jacob did not believe them, because his mind was slow to comprehend this new development.\n\n###Verse 27\n*In this verse it says that after Jacob saw all the carts and evidence that Joseph was indeed alive that his spirit came back to him. This Hebrew word “rûaḥ” does generally mean spirit but it has a lot of sub meanings as well. Like breath, wind or life, so again it lends to what I had always thought that Jacob almost or maybe did have a heart attack then he revived. However, because of what we have discovered in the previous verse, I looked deeper into the meaning of the word “rûaḥ”. If you look at the seventh definition for the word in the Strongs (found in blue letter bible) definition we see that the word “rûaḥ” is also rarely used to mean the will or mind. So, this verse could very well be saying that Jacobs mind came back to him. We have one other word to look at here and that is “ḥāyâ” translated to revived here. This word typically means to live, so again this also fits with my original understanding. However, again, this word also has many uses and meanings. And if we are to continue with the idea that it was Jacob’s thoughts that stopped rather than his heart then we would use one of the alternate meanings here as well. The one that seems to fit best here would be that Jacob was refreshed. Basically, he is given new vigor and life because he has just discovered that his lost Child has been found. The other is that this word can be used to mean revived from discouragement. Ultimately this is a small thing to worry about, and it is very possible that they did stop Jacob’s heart with shocking news but I think the mind one is more likely. \n\n###Verse 28\n*Jacob is finally convinced and will go to see his long-lost son.\n\nNote "*" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.

Note 33 total includes sons and daughters. If we count, we find that Leah actually had 35 in her clan that we know of. In this section we only see the singular form of son “bēn” and daughter “baṯ” so, we can’t infer more than one daughter. But we can infer based on this count that Leah is still alive. This goes back to Leah’s age. When she married Jacob, he was in his 80’s likely around 84 years old. We are not given an age for Leah. However, we can make some educated assumptions based on this and other passages. We know that Leah and more importantly Leah’s maid was able to have children 5 years after this point. Now Leah and Rachel were likely similar in age maybe within 5 years of each other, although there could be a larger gap between them. However, Leah’s maid was likely a young adult when she started caring for Leah which would make her around 20 or so years older than Leah herself. In today’s world the average age of menopause is 52 years old this minus the 20 (years older than Leah) and 5 (years until she had a child by Jacob after Leah’s marriage to him) means that there would be a window where Leah probably was around 25 years old or younger when she was married. Rachel being the one he wanted to marry at the time means she was likely 16 or older which makes Leah likely 20 or older so in my opinion Leah was likely around 20 to 25 when she married Jacob so for easy math, she is likely approximately 60 years younger than Jacob. So, at this point she would be around 70 years old while her Nurse maid would have been 90, Rachel died in childbirth years ago but would have been about 65 at this point. Making Rachels maid about 85. Jacob was one of the last people to live extended years, beyond 100ish, and he will live to 147. So, it would not be that uncommon for both the maids to be dead of old age. At this point. I placed a lot of assumption here on these ages for the women but I think it is safe to say that these are good ballpark ages for these women. Anyway, to reiterate the bottom line. The bible says that there are 33 in this group and if we add them up, we come up with Rubin 5, plus Simeon 7, plus Levi 4, plus Judah 8 (minus 2 dead), plus Issachar 5, plus Zebulun 4, equals 31. That leaves 2 left which must be Leah and Dinah.\n\n###Verse 16\nGad = gāḏ = troop<br>\nZiphion = ṣip̄yôn = Iookout, watch-tower<br>\nHaggi = ḥagî = festive<br>\nShuni = šûnî = fortunate, rest, quiet<br>\nEzbon = 'eṣbōn = hasting to discern: I will be enlargement<br>\nEri = ʿērî = watchful<br>\nArodi = 'ărôḏî = I shall subdue: I shall roam<br>\nAreli = 'ar'ēlî = Lion of God, Heroic<br>\n*The sons of Gad. 8 boys listed.\n\n###Verse 17\nAsher = 'āšēr = happy<br>\nJimnah = yimnâ = Right hand, prosperity<br>\nIshuah = yišvâ = he will resemble, he will level<br>\nIsui = yišvî = he resembles me<br>\nBeriah = bᵊrîʿâ = with a friend<br>\nSerah = śeraḥ = the prince breathed, superfluity (overabundance or excess) <br>\nHeber = ḥeḇer = comrade, community<br>\nMalchiel = malkî'ēl = My king is God<br>\n*This has another girl listed Serah, daughter of Asher.

Note again Bilhah would be 8 so she is no longer living as well.\n\n###Verse 26\n*Let’s do some quick math here. Leah 33, plus Zilpah 16, plus Rachel 14, plus Bilhah 7, equals 70. Here we see that there are 66 that come form Jacobs body that are going into Egypt with him. We have already accounted for 70 however, Joseph and his 2 boys are already in Egypt so they are out this gets us to 67. Then since Leah herself did not come from Jacob’s body she is not part of the 66 as well. This is where the 66 number comes from. We need to also keep in mind that this number does specifically exclude the wives of Jacobs sons. I will note, other methods I have come across that people have used to account for this difference but every other one that I have seen ether does not account for the smaller numbers (33 Leah, 16 Zilpah, 14 Rachel and 7 Bilhah), or includes dead people in the count.\n\n###Verse 27\n*Now we are back to the total of 70 people that went to Egypt with Jacob. Some here say that Jacob himself is the 70th person rather than Leah, which works when comparing the 66 to 70 but does not account for why Genesis 46:15 says there are 33. Anyway, we are at 70 everything matches and lines up… until you read Acts 7:14. So, is it 70 or 75? To start with we can take a look at Exodus 1:5 and Deuteronomy 10:22. These both say 70. So, was Stephen wrong? Well, it turns out that if you read Genesis 46 in the Septuagint it is a little different than what we see in the Masoretic text. In the Septuagint, the bible Stephen would have read, it says there are 75 that went into Egypt. It also lists 5 more people that are in the lines of Ephraim and Manasseh. They are Manasseh’s son Machir and grandson Galaad. And from Ephraim we have sons Sutalaam and Taam, and grandson Edom by Sutalaam. So, there are 5 more people listed and it says there were 66 that went into Egypt with a total of 75. So, it seems like this is why the passage in acts records Stephen as saying 75 rather than 70. Now, remember we still have not accounted for the wives of Jacobs sons. If we assume one each, and that they have not died, then this would add to the number a minimum of 14 people to the count because each of the 12 had to have at least 1 and Judah, Asher both had grandchildren. There could have been 137 if each of the children listed here had a wife. Could even be more if any had more than one. Now this is just a number given for the family of Jacob we are not given a number for how many people including servants that Jacobs household had that likely would have gone into Egypt with him. If we use Genesis 14:14 as a guide we see that Abraham has 318 trained servants who were ready to fight and save lot. It is pretty certain that all these were adult men. So, Abrahams household was likely at least double and possibly triple that number. However, if we use the 318 as a guide then it is very possible that Jacob brought in 318 times 70 people, which equals 22,260 people that number seems high to me but the idea is clear Jacob could have brought in a lot of people to Egypt with him.\n\n###Verse 28\n*They head into the land of Goshen in Egypt\n\n###Verse 29\n*When Jacob arrives, Joseph goes to finally see his father after all these years.\n\n###Verse 30\n*This feels kind of an odd line here. However, if we remember verse 4 above the Lord told Jacob that he would see Joseph and then he would die. This is just Jacob responding with trust to what the LORD has told him.\n\n###Verse 31\n*Joseph decides to go and tell Pharo that his family has safely arrived in Egypt.\n\n###Verse 32\n*Joseph plans to tell Pharo that his family occupation is to be shepherds. \n\n###Verse 33\n*It seems that Joseph is coaching them a little here to make sure and tell Pharo that they are shepherds. I wonder if this is because Joseph wants them to be able to live in the land of Goshen and that this land is reserved for those who grow livestock. Or maybe because Joseph knows that Egyptians don’t like shepherds Joseph wants to tell Pharo first so that Pharo will be ready and accept them anyway for Josephs sake. \n\n###Verse 34\nYouth = nāʿur = youth, early life\n*This verse seems to confirm the first idea that he wants them to be able to dwell in Goshen so he is making sure they have the same answer to Pharo’s question so that Pharo will let them live in the land of Goshen.\n\nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible. English words taken from New King James Version\n",
      '47': '###Verse 1\n*Joseph goes and reports to Pharaoh that his family has arrived and is in the land of Goshen.\n\n###Verse 2\n*Next, he takes a few of his brothers to meet Pharaoh.\n\n###Verse 3\n*Pharaoh asks about what they do for a living and they do as Joseph instructed and say that they are shepherds. Another thought I had about this is that maybe this is a way to keep Israelites separate from Egyptians because they find shepherds to be an abomination. \n\n###Verse 4\nPasture = mirʿê = the place of feeding animals (tame or wild), pasture<br>\n*Even thought there is a famine it seems that there are some things growing in the Nile delta because of the river supplying water. This also makes it seem like the famine is due to drought. \n\n###Verse 5\n*Pharaoh confirms with Joseph that the rest of his family made it safely into Egypt.\n\n###Verse 6\nBest = mêṭāḇ = the best part, the best<br>\n*Pharaoh gives Joseph the ability to make his brothers become chief herdsmen among the Egyptians. My personal thoughts on this are that Pharaoh knows how valuable Joseph is and is likely assuming that his brothers will be good as chiefs over the herdsmen as well. Another interesting point about the Hyksos is that according to scholars the word itself means ether foreign kings or shepherd kings. This is yet another connection between the Israelites and the Hyksos. They are made chief herdsmen of the existing herdsmen in Egypt. So, it is not a stretch to say they are shepherd kings. \n\n###Verse 7\nBlessed = bāraḵ = -to kneel, by implication: to bless God or man, by euphemism: to curse God or king.<br>\n*Pharaoh meets Jacob. Now it says here that Jacob blessed Pharaoh. Biblical scholars point out here that a rule of thumb is that the more important person blesses the less important person which would mean that Pharaoh recognizes the Jacob is more important than he is when at this point in history due to the famine the Pharaoh is likely the most powerful man in the entire world. However, if we look at the Hebrew, we see that while the figurative meaning of “bāraḵ” is to bless, the literal meaning is the kneel. So, in my mind it is very likely that Jacob met Pharaoh the most powerful man in the world and then knelt down. This would also match the person Jacob is and how he acted around Esau and Laban.\n\n###Verse 8\n*Remember at this point people are living more normal ages so Pharaoh seems curious about Jacob’s age.\n\n###Verse 9\n*Jacob says he is 130 years old and says that his days are few and evil compared to his fathers. It seems that Jacob regrets some of the choices he has made in life. Also note that he points out that his ancestors lived much longer than he has. If we look back at Genesis 11:16-17 we see Eber. He is in the line and the 6x great grandfather of Jacob. If you add the ages of Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Abraham, and Isaac you will find that Eber still alive for the first 19 to 79 years of Jacobs life. (79 if you say Abraham was born when Terah was 70, Genesis 11:26. 19 if you use Genesis 11:28 through Genesis 12:4 to says that Haran is up to 60 years older than Abraham.) Whatever age you believe in that range the point remains that Jacob could have personally met his 6x great grandfather Eber and at a minimum would have known of his existence. Another interesting fact is the Hebrew word “ʿiḇrî” translated Hebrew means descendant of Eber. So, when Jacob knows someone that lived 464 years then he would naturally tell Pharaoh that he hasn’t lived very long because he is only 130 years old.\n\n###Verse 10\n*Ether a second blessing or a final bow before leaving Pharaoh’s presence.\n\n###Verse 11\nRameses = raʿmᵊsēs = children of the sun, or child of Ra<br>\n*Rameses is a location that was given for the children of Israel to live in. The name of this place changes over the years and was called Rameses in the time period after the children of Israel left Egypt. During the time period while the children of Israel were living there it was called Avaris. This is also the seat of power for the people known as Hyksos. Today it is known as Tell el-Dab‘a. \n\n###Verse 12\n*For the next 5 years there is still a famine in the land and Joseph made sure his family was provided for however we will see something a little different from the others.\n\n###Verse 13\nLanguished = lāhâ = to burn, by implication: to be rabid, figuratively: insane, also used to mean to languish due to exhaustion from the frenzy<br>\n*It seems like it is sinking in for the people just how bad this famine is. Remember the LORD showed pharaoh that the famine would be so severe that the 7 years of plenty will be forgotten.\n\n###Verse 14\n*First Joseph gathers up all the money from the people to pharaoh so they can buy grain.\n\n###Verse 15\nFailed = tāmam = to complete, be finished (can be used in a good or bad sense)<br>\nFailed = \'āp̄as = to disappear, cease, come to an end<br>\n*At some point the people come to Joseph because they have run out of money and they still need food to live. So, they come to Joseph asking what to do. Note here we have two different words used that are both translated to the same English word. \n\n###Verse 16\n*Josephs solution is to have the people buy grain by trading livestock for it. The Livestock would have then been placed under the care of Josephs brothers increasing their power and influence in the area. Again, Hyksos were said by most to have ruled Egypt for a time, however, some said they were powerful advisors to pharaoh.\n\n###Verse 17\nHorses = sûs = to skip, swift, a horse, also a swallow<br>\n*Joseph takes all kinds of livestock in trade for grain.\n\n###Verse 18\nHide = kāḥaḏ = to secret, hide, intensively: to destroy<br>\n*The people are now out of money and livestock so they come back to Joseph and ask to sell not only their land but to become slaves of pharaoh. This really highlights how desperate the situation is and Joseph likely increases the power of the pharaoh in Egypt from this point on.\n\n###Verse 19\nDesolate = yāšam = to lie waste, be desolate<br>\n*Once the Egyptians sell themselves, they have nothing left to bargain with. However, they will also become pharaohs to take care of so pharaoh will have to feed them without them having to buy more so, in this situation this move makes since.\n\n###Verse 20\n*We can see here where pharaoh did indeed greatly increase his power because of the actions of the LORD thought Joseph. This to me is a clear example of how the LORD sets up all leaders sometimes those leaders are good, sometimes they are bad but if it was not for the LORD then pharaoh and every pharaoh after him would not have been nearly as powerful as they became. When comparing to Egyptian history I think the mostly likely candidate for this pharaoh is Amenemhat I. The history of Egypt is broken into several major eras. First the Predynastic Period is when Egyptians first started getting established and there were 2 kingdoms and northern and southern. Second is the Archaic Period when one pharaoh was able to take over all of Egypt and the Egyptian religion was developed during this time. Third is the Old Kingdom, this is when many of the structures we know of today were built, including the Great Pyramid. Fourth during the First Intermediate Period the kingdom collapsed and fell into a time of civil war and chaos. Many pharaohs would rise and fall with short reigns and had little power. Then we get to the 5th era known as the Middle Kingdom. Out of this chaos one pharaoh seems to rise to power quickly. Most scholars say that he was the vizier of the previous king and was not even of royal lineage. Yet some how very early on in his rule he was able to go from extreme political turmoil to consolidating Egypt into a place with a centralized government and was the first pharaoh to build a pyramid since the time of the old kingdom. He started the entire Middle Period a time of growth and prosperity for Egypt. A couple of other points to make Amenemhet I reigned for about 30 years beginning around 2000 BC. The Hyksos people would be expelled from Egypt in the range of around 1570 BC to 1525 BC. 2000 BC to 1570 BC is 430 years which is the amount of time the Bible says the Israelites were in Egypt.  Also having all of Egypt sell themselves as slaves to a pharaoh would produce these exact events.\n\n###Verse 21\n*The people move into the cities under pharaoh’s new centralized government.\n\n###Verse 22\nRations = ḥōq = an enactment, an appointment, something prescribed, a statute<br>\n*One group of people that did not need to sell their land were the priests because they were already fed by pharaoh for being priests.\n\n###Verse 23\n*The people are now owned by pharaoh so Joseph gives seed for them to eat and plant.\n\n###Verse 24\nHarvest = tᵊḇû\'â = income, produce, product, revenue<br>\n*Notice what slavery means back then slavery means to pay 20% taxes to the government. Applying this same principle in today’s world we would all be slaves even our pastor pays taxes.\n\n###Verse 25\n*At least for now the people seem grateful to pay this because the alternative is death.\n\n###Verse 26\nOne-fifth = ḥōmeš = a fifth tax (only time this word appears in the bible)<br>\nPriests = kōhēn = -one officiating, a priest<br>\n*Joseph creates a law that from now on all but the priests will be taxed. Looking at the meaning of the word “kōhēn” we see that it would also include other government officials. \n\n###Verse 27\n*I believe that the Israelites would be exempt from the slavery for now because they are officials of the shepherds. We see here that the Israelites were not treated as slaves and were able to keep their possessions. They prosper and grow in number very quickly.\n\n###Verse 28\n*We see here that Jacob lives to be 147 years old. Jacob thought he would die soon because the LORD said that he would see his son Joseph before he dies. But the LORD blessed Jacob and Joseph with 17 years together.\n\n###Verse 29\n*Jacob makes Joseph promise that he will bring Jacob out of Egypt and will not bury him there. We discussed this custom earlier in Genesis 24:9. There are a few options for the meaning behind this. It could be symbolizing authority siting on someone’s hand simply means you are above that person so they need to obey you. Or it could be a more symbolic meaning the Hebrew word “yāḏ” translated to hand also means power. And the word “yārēḵ” translated thigh could also mean loins. So, this could mean that Joseph’s could be promising by Jacob’s descendants rather than just to Jacob himself. Or it could even be related to circumcision and basically saying Joseph’s power is under the LORD’s covenant. \n\n###Verse 30\n*Jacob asks Joseph to bring him back to the tomb of his fathers Abraham and Isaac so he can be buried with them.\n\n###Verse 31\nBed = miṭṭâ = a bed, for sleeping or eating, by analogy: a sofa, litter or bier<br>\n*This line could mean that Jacob died because the word used for bed could mean bier which is a stand that holds a coffin. However, verse one of the next chapter says after this Jacob was sick. So, it seems like Jacob is getting really sick and knows that he will die soon. So, Jacob wants to take care of some last-minute things before he dies and this is one of them.\n\nNote "*" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible. English words taken from New King James Version\n',
      '48': "###Verse 1\nSick = ḥālâ = to be rubbed or worn, figuratively: to be weak, sick, or afflicted, causatively: to grieve or make sick, used in flattery: entreat<br>\n*Jacob is old and now sick so Joseph brings his sons over to visit.\n\n###Verse 2\n*Jacob seems to be happy that his son and grandsons are coming to visit him.\n\n###Verse 3\nLuz = lûz = Almond tree (the same place as Bethel)<br>\n*Jacob starts by saying that the LORD has appeared to him, at Bethel, this happened twice in his life. First on the way out to go and work under Laban’s house, and again when he returned. These are found in Genesis 28 and Genesis 35.\n\n###Verse 4\n*Jacob, like Isaac did with him in Genesis 28, passes on the blessing of the LORD to his descendants. Jacob makes sure the Joseph knows that the LORD has given the land to them.\n\n###Verse 5\n*Here we see that Jacob claims Ephraim and Manasseh has his own children. Remember for inheritance at the time the father would divide the inheritance into relatively equal parts. The number of these parts would be equal to the number of children plus one. So, in this case Jacob would divide his inheritance into 13 parts, then a double portion is given to the first born. However, in this case because of Reuben decided to lay with Bilhah after Rachel’s death Jacob takes away Reuben’s first born privileges. Here we see that Jacob is giving the double portion to Joseph his first born of Rachel. So, both Ephraim and Manasseh get a single full portion of the inheritance. This is part of the reason why Ephraim and Manasseh are included as part of the 12 tribes of Israel. It seems that the LORD may at least partly agree with Jacob. We see the spiritual inheritance, the line that would lead to Jesus, is not passed on though Reuben ether. However, it seems that the LORD views Leah as the true wife of Jacob. So, rather than having Jesus come through Joseph he has Jesus come through Judah. It seems that the LORD may have passed by Simion and Levi for slaughtering an entire town when getting revenge for their sister. \n\n###Verse 6\n*Jacob just confirming here that there will be a tribe of Ephriam and a tribe of Manasseh rather than one tribe of Joseph.\n\n###Verse 7\n*Jacob recounts the events of Rachel’s death and burial. (Note I think she is buried at Haeleph, look at my notes on Genesis 35:20 if you want my reasoning behind that). \n\n###Verse 8\n*After Jacob says these things to Joseph, then Joseph’s children are brought before Jacob. However, because of his bad eyesight he needs someone to tell him who they are.\n\n###Verse 9\n*Joseph tells Jacob who they are and recognizes that they are given by the LORD.\n\n###Verse 10\n*Jacob can’t see will but greets his grandchildren that he is claiming as his own.\n\n###Verse 11\n*We see here that while Jacob’s eyesight is failing, he still is able to see better than his father once the grandchildren got closer. Jacob also rejoices in the fact that even though he thought his son was dead, the LORD allowed Jacob so see Joseph’s grandchildren. Remember Joseph’s children were born sometime during the seven years of plenty. Jacob entered Egypt during the second year of famine and then lived for another 17 years. To me this seems like just before Jacob dies so 19 years for sure with a range of 0 to 6 years added depending on if they were born closer to the earliest possible or the latest possible time. This means that Ephriam and Manasseh are likely in their early 20’s at this point.\n\n###Verse 12\n1 So, Brought = yāṣā' = to go out, wide variety of applications both literal and figurative<br>\n2 Joseph = yôsēp̄ = Jehovah has added<br>\n3 Them = 'ēṯ = can be use to mean self, generally a word not used in English that points to the object of a verb or preposition, (like even or namely)<br>\n4 From Beside = ʿim = with, word is a conjuction often used with a prepositional prefix (this word is also usually unrepresented in English)<br>\n5 His knees = bereḵ = knee<br>\n6 And He Bowed Down = šāḥâ = to depress, prostrate, bow down<br>\n7 With His Face = 'ap̄ = the nose or nostril, the face, occasionally a person, (also the idea of flareing the nostril in anger due to rapid breathing), so ire or anger<br>\n8 To The Earth = 'ereṣ = to be firm, the earth, land<br>\n*There is a lot of debate about this verse. In the Masoretic text (Hebrew) there are just 8 words used for this verse, and two of those words are not generally used in English. This is where I personally think the confusion comes from. For example, “ʿim” is used in Genesis 13:1 to describe that Lot went “with” Abraham. However, in Genesis 13:14 the same word “ʿim” is used to describe that Lot “separated” from Abraham. To start with, a strait translation of the Hebrew says, “to go out/ Jehovah has added (Joseph)/ self or point to object of preposition or verb/ with or unused in English/ knee/ depress/ nose or face or anger/ firm or the earth/”. So does this say “Go out, Jehovah has added self with knee, depressed anger on earth”? Or, “Going out Joseph with knee depressed, nose to earth”? Well, lets look at what various biblical scholar’s say. Some, like Keil, Delitzsch and Cambridge see Ephram and Manasseh being children at this point. Cambridge of them place the children as sitting on Jacob’s knees as a sign that Jacob will be adopting them. This verse says that they are bought off of Jacobs knees and all three bow before Jacob. They also discuss that maybe it was Jacob who bowed in giving thanks to God for being able to adopt the children. They even point out the possibility that these events are connected with Genesis 47:29-31 and Joseph still has his hand under Jacob’s thigh and so Joseph had to literally with draw from beside or in KJV from between Jacob’s knee. The other two say that the children were on Joseph’s knees and they had to move so Joseph could bow. The major problem I have with this is that it seems that Jacob is sick and on his death bed. We know that Ephraim and Manasseh would be in early 20’s at this point and I don’t see them sitting on anyone’s knees at that age. I suppose the argument could be made that this occurred shortly after Jacob arrived in Egypt when the children would have been somewhere between 2 and 8 years old, but based on the context this seems very unlikely. Also, in order to connect the events of Genesis 47 with this you need to be very creative with Genesis 48:2, where it specifically says that Joseph is coming from far off, that can’t happen if Joseph’s hand is still under Jacob’s thigh at this point. Most other scholars fall into 3 major categories. They say that: 1 Jacob was already bowed and the two boys had to go up to him beside or between his knees to greet him so in this verse they withdraw from that position to then go beside Joseph so Joseph can bow his nose to the ground before Jacob. 2 Some, say that it is Ephriam and Manasseh that come from beside Joseph to go and bow in front of Jacob to receive the blessing (this one has support from the Septuagint). Some have Joseph bowing with them on this one. Others have Joseph bowing by himself. 3 From beside or between his knees is merely pointing out that these two were descendants of Jacob and there was no physical movement in this section. Out of these I think any one of them could be correct. However, if I had to pick one, then I would say at this point I lean toward #2 because to me it seems like in a real-life situation this would be the most natural flow of events with what has happened just prior to this and what will happen immediately after.\n\n###Verse 13\n*Jacob positions his first born to Jacob’s right hand and his second born to Jacob’s left hand.\n\n###Verse 14\nKnowingly = śāḵal = to be circumspect, intelligent or prudent<br>\n*Jacob switches his hands and places his right on Ephriam the younger son. Most view this as the LORD leading Jacob to give Ephraim the better blessing.\n\n###Verse 15\n*Jacob begins the blessing by bringing attention to the LORD.\n\n###Verse 16\nThe Angel = mal'āḵ = -to dispatch as a deputy, a messenger, specifically from GOD: an angel, prophet, priest or teacher<br>\nWho Has Redeemed = gā'al = to redeem, buy back property of relative as next of kin<br>\nGrow = dāḡâ = to move rapidly, to spawn, become numerous (only time this word is used in the bible)<br>\n*Jacob is not saying here that an angel redeemed him. The word “mal'āḵ” means to dispatch an angel so Jacob is saying that the LORD has sent an angel or messenger to relay the message of the LORD redeeming Jacob. These two verses are the blessing for Joseph himself.\n\n###Verse 17\nDispleased = rāʿaʿ = to spoil, figuratively: to make or be good for nothing, bad/evil morally or physically<br>\nTook hold = tāmaḵ = to sustain, by implication: to obtain, keep fast, figuratively: to help, follow close<br>\n*Joseph tries to switch Jacob’s hands to match the birth order. The NKJV seems to imply that the reason for this was because Joseph didn’t like Ephriam getting a better blessing, which is very possible. However, if we look at the more in-depth description of the word “rāʿaʿ” we see that it can mean sadness or even causing an injury.  And figuratively “tāmaḵ” could simply mean to help. So, I think it is possible that Joseph wasn’t necessarily upset. Rather, Joseph could have thought that Jacob placed his hand wrong because of his bad eyesight and therefore Joseph was simply trying to help out his father to place his hands in the correct position. On a side note, if Joseph’s nose was on the ground while he was receiving his blessing then it would make since for Joseph to not notice that Jacob hands were in the wrong place until now.\n\n###Verse 18\n*Jacob explains to his father which one is the first born. Again, with poor eye sight Joseph may have assumed that Jacob made a mistake. Also note that it is made clear that Jacob can still see up close at least somewhat. This is another point of evidence, in my mind, that the children are grown. If they were 7 and 4 for example, then it would have been obvious which was born first and there would be no need to point out that fact to Jacob. But with poor eyesight it may have been harder for Jacob to tell apart the 24-year-old from his 21-year-old brother.\n\n###Verse 19\n*Again, here we see that Jacob confirms that he knows who’s head he is holding and Joseph doesn’t seem to say anything else negative. In fact, Joseph would be aware that Jacob himself is the younger brother with the better blessing. Like I said before to Joseph could be displeased about it, but it seems just as likely, if not more likely, that Jacob, with is administrative personality, was simply trying to help his father to do the blessing correctly. This also serves as an example to show that the LORD’s will, will be done. If the LORD wants the younger son to have the better blessing it will be done one way or another. Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Ephriam, and even Judah. All younger sons that the LORD gave a better blessing to using various different methods.\n\n###Verse 20\n*Now the blessing for the Ephraim and Manasseh are given. And indeed, Jacob specifically places Ephriam above Manasseh in the blessing.\n\n###Verse 21\n*Jacob gives an addition to the blessing for Joseph saying that his descendants will also bring Joseph back to the promised land as well. We also get another piece of evidence here that Jacob is probably closer to 147 at this point rather than 130 which means the boys are grown.\n\n###Verse 22\n*Here we get the confirmation where Jacob clearly points out that Joseph will be the one to receive the double portion, rather than Reuben.\n \nNote \"*\" marks my thoughts on the verse and all the Hebrew and Greek words are taken from the Interlinear Blue Letter Bible.
